<H1>DecoderPro - in depth</H1>

<p>This page provides information on how the DecoderPro Symbolic
Programmer works.  For details on JMRI internals, please see the technical
pages, which are still being developed.</p>

<dl>
<dt class=left>Configuration files</dt>
<dd class=first>
<p>
There are two types of configuration files:
<ul>
<li> Decoder configuration files - These carry the description of a specific type of decoder, and control how the programmer displays the variable information.
<li> Locomotive configuration files - These carry the specific information on a single locomotive.
</ul>
</p>

<p>The programmer can read either type of file. If you select a decoder
file after clicking Read File, the programmer will be set up with the
variables, options, etc for that type. The values will be blank, as the
programmer doesn't know anything about what's been programmed into a
specific decoder unit.</p>

<p>If you select a locomotive file after clicking Read File, information on
both the decoder configuration and the specific settings in this locomotive
will be displayed. This shows you how the locomotive is already configured,
allowing you to make small changes with less chance of confusion.</p>

<p>You can also write locomotive files with the Write File button. This
will store the known contents of the decoder, allowing you to come back to
it later. </p>

<p> The configuration files are stored in XML format. This is a standard
form for structured data. XML is being widely used to standardize the
exchange of data between different manufacturers in many fields; perhaps
someday DCC decoder manufacturers will provide an XML description of each
decoder they make. In the meantime, the configuration files are being
created by volunteers. If one doesn't exist for a specific decoder you've
got, you can
<a href="CreateDecoder.html">create your own</a>.
You can also modify a file if you'd prefer
different names, a different grouping of options, or you just never want to
see that certain options that you don't use. A simple text editor can
create these files easily, as the format doesn't have fixed length fields,
special characters, etc. There are also powerful public-domain XML tools
that make it really easy to manage a large number of decoder files.</p>
</dd>

<dt class=left>Variables</dt>
<dd>
<p>A "variable" defines the value that will be loaded into all or part of a
CV. For example, a variable can be defined that sets the value of the three
most-significant bits of CV 47. If there are several options configured in
a single CV, these would normally be handled by separate variables.
Currently, there are several types of variables:
<ul>
<LI> Decimal - numbers entered in the usual decimal notation. These are
useful for short address, starting voltages, etc.
<LI> Enum (enumerated) - choose from a set of options. These can be used
for simple on/off, yes/no choices, or more complicated sets like the FX
lighting example above. The configuration contains a name for each
possibility.
<LI> Long address - like a decimal value, except the constraints on a valid
long address are taken into account.
<LI> Hex - This is not so much needed, since the multiple options in a
single CV can be handled by multiple variables. But if its needed for some
reason, the capability is present.
<LI> Speed table - not yet really working well, this type of variable is
intended to provide a graphic speed table chart that you can drag around to
configure as you wish.
</ul></p>
</dd>

<dt class=left>Programmer communication: states</dt>
<dd>
<p>Communication with the command station / programmer, hence reading and
writing of the decoder, are only done when the "Read" or "Write" buttons
are pressed. The program keeps track of whether a value has been sent to
the decoder using four states for variables or CVs:
<ul>
<li> Read - The value shown was read from the decoder.
<LI> Stored - The value shown has been written to the decoder.
<LI> Editted - The value shown has been changed in the computer, but
not yet written to the decoder. Push the Write button when you're happy
with the value.
<LI> Unknown - A default value, or a read has failed, or for some other
reason the program has no confidence that the value is what you really
want. Edit the value or press the Write button.
</ul></p>
</dd>

<dt class=left>Printing</dt>
<dd>
<p>You can print the current locomotive's information from the programmer
windows. From the "File..." menu, select "Print...", and fill out the
dialog box that's presented.</p>

<p>The printout is formatted by the currently-selected programmer format,
so the information on all of the tabs is printed. You get a shorter
printout of just the most important values when you print from the "Basic"
format, and a listing of everything when you use "Comprehensive". </p>
