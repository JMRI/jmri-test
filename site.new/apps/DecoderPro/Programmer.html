<H1>DecoderPro User Guide - Create a custom programmer</H1>

<p>How do I create my own custom programmer?</p>

<p>The answer starts with the creation of an xml file in the
"programmers" subdirectory of the JMRI distribution.  The
contents of the file are described below.</p>

<dl>
<dt class=left>Specifying items to display</dt>
<dd class=first>
<p>The basic element of a programmer pane is a "display". This tells the
programmer to present a single variable.  The attributes are:
<ul>
<li><dfn>name</dfn> - (Required)
This is the "standard name" of the variable to be presented.
<li><dfn>label</dfn> -
If present, this will be used to label the variable on the pane
instead of the name or standard name of the variable.
<li><dfn>layout</dfn> -
Where to locate the label with respect to the edittable field,
e.g. the text box.  Possible values are "left", "above",
"below", "right" with a default of "right".
<li><dfn>format</dfn> -
<p>How the variable should be presented.  Numeric variables can be presented as
<ul>
<li>an editable text field, which is the default if nothing is specified
<li><dfn>hslider</dfn> - a horizontal slider
<li><dfn>vslider</dfn> - a vertical slider
</ul></p>
<p>Enum variables can be presented as
<ul>
<li>a selection box, which is the default if nothing is
specified
<li><dfn>radiobuttons</dfn> - Each possible value is presented
as an individual button
<li><dfn>checkbox</dfn> - An enum with only two states can also
be presented as a checkbox
<li><dfn>offradiobutton</dfn> - A single button that sets the 0
choice for the variable when selected
<li><dfn>onradiobutton</dfn> - A single button that sets the 1
choice for the variable when selected
</ul></p>
<p>These last two can be useful for indicating which parts of a
configuration are active; see the "Speed Table" pane of
Comprehensive.xml for an example.</p>
<li><dfn>tooltip</dfn> -
Allows you to specify a tooltip to be presented when the cursor
is left over the variable.  If not present, the tooltip defined
in the decoder file is used. (Note: This is not fully
implemented yet, but you should include them in your programmer
definitions as they will work soon)
</ul>

<A id="display"/>
<p> Which name to display is controlled by the pane's  'nameFmt'
attribute, and the 'label' attribute on each display element (variable).</p>

<p>The choices are:
<ul>
<li>If a label is specified, it will be used.  Use a label if you
want absolute control over what a variable should be called, regardless
of what the decoder file calls it, and you don't like the standard name.
<li>The pane's nameFmt attribute is "item", in which case the item
name will be used regardless of what the decoder file calls the variable.
Use this is you want a uniform appearance for the pane for all decoders.
But be aware that some standard names are really so generic as to be useless.
<li>If the pane's nameFmt attribute is allowed to default, or contains "mfg",
the decoder definition file's name will be used.  This is the normal form,
as it allows a manufacturer to specify in some detail what a
variable defines.
</ul></p>
</dd>

<dt class=left>Formatting</dt>
<dd>
<p>Each pane of the programmer consists of (nested) rows and/or columns.
Columns lay out variables from top to bottom.  Rows lay out variables from
left to right.  You can nest these to achieve various effects; for an
example of this, see the "Speed Table" pane of the Comprehensive.xml file.
It has two columns, the left of each uses a row to put some sliders from
left to right.</p>
</dd>

<dt class=left>Special Elements</dt>
<dd>
There are a number of elements you can use to get the programmer
formatted exactly the way you want:
<ul>
<li><dfn>label</dfn> - Add text to a pane.
<li><dfn>separator</dfn> - Add a separator line to a pane.  If included
in a column, this will be a horizontal separator line.  If
included in a row, it will be a vertical line.
<li><dfn>cvtable</dfn> - Insert a table of CV values onto the pane.
To get the spacing right, etc, you should probably not combine
this with other variables on the same pane.
<li><dfn>fnmapping</dfn> - Show a function mapping grid.
This requires variables with specific names, which
are described on a
<A HREF="FnMapping.html">separate page</a>.
<li><dfn>dccaddress</dfn> - Show a combined variable for the DCC address.  This
consists of a checkbox that selects use of short vs long address, and
a single text field for entering the address.  Depending on how
the checkbox is set, the text field will configure the CV1 short
address or the CV17/18 long address.
</ul>
</dd>

<dt class=left>Installing your new programmer</dt>
<dd>
<p>
All of the .xml files in the "programmers" subdirectory will
appear in the selection box when you create a new programmer in
Decoder Pro.  To use your new file, just put it in the
"programmers" subdirectory of the "prefs" directory and
select it.  You don't have to restart the program, as the
list is remade each time you open a new programmer window.

<p> There is an option to present/hide panes from the decoder file.  If
you're writing a very basic programmer, you might want to hide them.</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<h3>How variables in a decoder file match up with the programmer file</h3>

Each decoder file defines 
<A HREF="CreateDecoder.html#variable">variables</a> that describe specific controls within the
decoder.  The programmer file then describes how to place those on
panes so that the user can find and manipulate them.
<P>
Each "display" element in the programmer file defines one thing to show.
But which one?  That's controlled by the "name" attribute
of the "display" element.  DecoderPro takes that "name" and looks through
the decoder definition for a "variable" element that has either the
same "item" or "label" attribute.
<P>
This has some nice effects:
<OL>
<LI>The "name" in the "display" element is effectively a "standard name", that 
can be used in decoder definition files from many different
manufacturers.  Since this is separate from the "label" on the decoder
variable, it's possible to have a generic programmer file that works for
many types of different decoders, while still displaying specific variable
names.  For more on this, please
<A HREF="#display">see above</a>.
<LI>
It lets you use very generic names to control where somewhat different
things go.  For example, different sound decoders provide different
controls.  One might have "Airpump", while another doesn't have that
at all, and instead has "Brake Squeal".  We don't want to have 
the programmer files contain zillions of "display" elements to
handle every possible option.  Instead, we use elements with more
generic names, like "Sound Option 1", for the display name.
<P>
The decoder definition then has a "label" of "Airpump" or whatever, and
an "item" of "Sound Option 1". Everything matches up properly, and
"Airpump" appears on the computer's screen.
</OL>
<P>
