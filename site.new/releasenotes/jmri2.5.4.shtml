      Release Notes for JMRI 2.5.4 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2009</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.5.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the fourth in a new series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a production release in late June 2009.

It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>
<li>
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.


<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.5 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.6" available for download today. -->

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

If you're using a MERG CAN-RS or CAN-USB unit to talk to a MERG CBUS, you should
check that your preferences are set properly.

<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

Starting with version 2.5.3, JMRI uses a new version of the Log4J library, and 
several additional libraries.  If you've written your own
Java code using JMRI, or have your own startup scripts, you
might have to make some changes to adapt to these new libraries.
If you don't get messages about missing or deprecated methods,
you don't have to worry about this.

<p>
The XSLT location was moved back to the web in JMRI 2.5.3.

<p>
Starting in JMRI 2.5.2, Logix support has a lot of
new capabilities, but panel files that use these capabilities
can't be read by previous versions of the program. 
Please keep backup copies of your panel files in case you
want to move back to a previous version.

<p>
Starting in JMRI 2.5.2, 
there have been extensive changes to the way JMRI installs and starts on Windows.
If you have custom shortcuts (ones you made), you may have to update them.
The JMRI-created ones will be updated automatically.  Users of Mac OS X and Linux
will not be affected by this change.

<p>
The downloads are significantly larger due to more text and images
in the help pages, especially the updated manual.

<p>JMRI now requires Java 5 or later. (Java 5 is also called Java 1.5)
If you are using an older version of Java, please
<a href="http://www.sun.com/getjava">upgrade your Java installation</a>.  
To see JMRI's future plans for this and other compatibility issues, please see the JMRI
<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technology roadmap</a>.

<p>
Starting in JMRI 2.5.1,
the way you drag things in the Layout Editor has changed if you
are using a Linux computer.

<h3>Changes since test version 2.5.3:</h3>

Andrew Crosland sorted out a problem with the GridConnect connections to CAN and CBUS.
This fixes a problem sending frames that was present in JMRI 2.5.1 and 2.5.2.
Note that if you're using a MERG CAN-RS or CAN-USB unit, you should
check that your preferences are set properly.

<p>
Dan Boudreau made some operations updates. 
The "show route" location box as grayed out if train can't service that location.
The location print/preview now includes which car types and roads are serviced 
by each location and track.

<p>
Dan Boudreau improved reporting and printing in the operations tools.
You can now see and print what type of cars and engines can be serviced by a location.
You can also request thatall of the info provided by the edit location be printed.

<p>
Paul Bender added support for F13-F28 on Lenz systems upgraded to XPressNet version 3.6.

<p>
Paul Bender updated the XPressNet support for the Hornby Elite: 
Do not send the "OFF" XPressNet message 
(The Elite appears to react in the same manner to both the "ON" messages and the "OFF" messages).

<p>
Dick Bronson improved the USS CTC panel background images in 
<a href="http://jmri.org/resources/icons/USS/background/">icons/USS/background</a> 
to remove the appearance of repetitive blotches in the track background area.
He also added some new 850 pixel high background slices sized to fit the new 1440 x
900 pixel wide screen monitors. 

<p>
A number of JMRI implementation classes have been moved to clean up the code organization.
This only effects you if you've written somehat low-level Java or Python code to e.g.
implement a new system.  If you've done that, and you encouter compilation problems,
look in the jmri.managers and jmri.implementation packages.
