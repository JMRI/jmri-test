      Release Notes for JMRI 2.1.5 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2008</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.1.5 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions.

It contains 
many new features, including:
<ul>
<!-- <li>Support for the X10 power adapters, -->
<!-- <li>improved consisting support, -->
<!-- <li>additional sounds and graphics for creating USS CTC panels, -->
<!-- <li>lots of additions to the help screens -->
<!-- <li>and several decoder definitions were added and improved. -->
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.


<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.1 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.2" available for download today. -->

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

The "Double Turnout" and "Triple Turnout" signals are now called
"Double Output" and "Triple Output" in an attempt to reduce confusion of new
users.  They still work the way they used to.

<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

Starting in this version, panels should not have duplicate names.  
The program assigns a unique default name to newly created panels, and will prevent you from renaming a panel to an existing name.
If you read a file containing a panel with a name that duplicates an existing panel's name, you'll get a warning message.
Depending on user reaction, this may become a dialog box that asks if you want to continue.

<p>
The scripts used to start the JMRI applications on Linux and MacOS X have been extensively reworked.  
The new ones should do everything the old ones do, plus
<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/install/ShellScripts.shtml">more</a>.  
Please keep an eye out for new problems, however, and don't hesitate to report them to the list.

<p>
JMRI 2.1.3 was created shortly after JMRI 2.1.2 to fix a bad new bug accidentally introduced in 2.1.2: If you save a roster entry, you can't read the values back in.  This new 2.1.3 version both corrects the problem, so that files are properly written out, and is able to read the corrupted files that 2.1.2 writes.
If you did not install JMRI 2.1.2, there's nothing to worry about.
If you did install JMRI 2.1.2, please install either 2.1.3 or this 2.1.5 release to correct the problem.

<p>
In JMRI 2.1.1, when you went to load a panel file, only files with a ".xml" filename suffix were shown by default. To see all files, you could select "All Files" in the window.  This caused some confusion because many people hadn't added the ".xml" suffix to their panel file names.  We still think having a suffix like that is valuable, but to reduce confusion in JMRI 2.1.2 when you save a panel file an ".xml" suffix is added automatically to the filename if you haven't already provided it.  This makes the filename filter work better when loading a file.  If you want to provide another suffix, or none at all, select the "All Files" option in the window before saving the file. 

<p>JMRI is moving toward requiring Java 1.4 or later.  Certain new features may not work if you are using an earlier
version of Java.  To see JMRI's future plans for this and other compatibility issues, please see the JMRI
<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technology roadmap</a>.

<p>JMRI no longer supports NCE AIU broadcasts. This change was needed so that JMRI could reliably read certain CV values. We recommend that if you use NCE AIUs, that you upgrade the command station EPROM to version 2007 or newer and turn off AIU broadcasts. Code has been added to detect if AIU broadcasts are enabled, and a warning message will appear at startup requesting that AIU broadcasts be turned off for proper operation of the JMRI programs.

<p>Indexed CVs will not be included in any printouts for this release.
 
<p>QSI CV 56.129 Engine ID Access is not supported in this release.
  
<p>While programming QSI decoders in Ops mode, it is necessary to disable CV 62 QSI Control (Verbal Acknowledgement), otherwise the writes will fail.
 
<p>QSI CV 64 CV Numeric Verbal Readout currently does not work for indexed CVs.
 
<p>The beginnings of support for the QSI Programmer device are present, but it's not complete yet

<h3>Changes since test version 2.1.4:</h3>

<p>
Robert Coleman 
<a href="../help/en/html/hardware/acela/index.shtml">added support</a>
for 
<a href="http://www.cti-electronics.com/app_sw.htm">CTI Acela</a> hardware.

<p>
Fix broken JMRI_HOME option in the new Linux and MacOS X startup scripts

<p>
Bill Chown has updated the MRC Big Boy decoder definition
and added lots more detail to the MRC 1645 definition.

<p>
Some older versions of the Java Help system couldn't follow internal links on the help pages. 
This is now fixed.

<p>
Dan Boudreau added a "don't show again" button to info message on panel close.

<p>
The "Double Turnout" and "Triple Turnout" signals are now called
"Double Output" and "Triple Output" in an attempt to reduce confusion of new
users.  They still work the way they used to.

<p>
The powerline adapter (X10) support has been rewritten to allow more adapter types
to work.  This shouldn't make any visible changes, but might have accidentally introduced
some bugs, so please keep an eye out. 

<p>
Many more help updates.  Please check it out, either in the 
program or 
<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/help/en/webtoc.html">on the web</a>.

<p>
Chris Zurek updated the Digitrax DH123 "Economy" decoder definition.

<p>
Ken Cameron and Bob Jacobsen added support for the CP290 house adapter to the 
<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/help/en/html/hardware/powerline/Compatibility.shtml">X10 powerline support</a>.

<p>
Dan Boudreau fixed a problem that would cause a lockup if a NCE command station crashed
while coming out of programing mode.

<p>
The new Mac OS X startup scripts would fail if placed in a directory with spaces in the name.
This has been fixed. Thanks to Graeme Brown for help figuring this out.

<p>
The "Check buffer on send" option for Lenz (XPressNet) protocols now defaults to "no" on MacOS X systems, "yes" on Windows and Linux.
If you've already set it and have it working, this shouldn't cause any trouble.

<p>
The Mac OS X distributions for JMRI 2.1.3 and 2.1.4 could not be opened on Mac OS X 10.3 and before.  This should be fixed for 
this version, thanks to Graeme Brown.

<p>
Certain locomotive decoders couldn't be programmed on the main with NCE systems
if they were moving.  Yes, that's a subtle bug, but Mark Schutzer and Dan Boudreau
tracked it down and fixed it, with help from NCE.

<p>
Dan Boudreau fixed some problems recently introduced into the "NCE over network" connection.

<p>
Martin Gostling updated the CML DAC10 decoder definition.

<p>
Paul Bender added a new Turnout operation (in the automate column of the
Turnout Table) called "raw".  This sends raw NMRA packets to the accessory decoder, rather
than using the command mechanisms in the DCC system.

<p>
Martin Gostling added some new models to the Digitrax FX3 decoder family.

<p>
The panel files that the program writes now have a little less redundant information in them.
If a particular category is empty, e.g. no Routes, the summary and manager information for that category written to the file.

<p>
You can no longer create a null Roster entry accidentally using the "Roster Copy" menu item.  If you try to copy to an invalid or empty ID, it prompts you to try again.
Also, the handling of roster filenames with special characters has been improved.

<p>
Giorgio Terdina has made it possible for JMRI to connect to his XPressNet 
<a href="http://www.terdina.net/rails/">XnTcp adapter</a>.
This lets JMRI connect to a remote layout using XPressNet.

<p>
Andrew Crosland provided a decoder definition for the Servo6 decoder.
