      Release Notes for JMRI 1.9.3 release
      </H2>

	<p>Date: MM DD, YYYY</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 1.9.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<P>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go back to an earlier version.

<P>This is the next in a series of test versions.
It contains 
many new features, including:
<UL>
<LI>several new decoder definitions
<LI>support for the fast clock on NCE systems
<LI>DecoderPro is much smarter about handling errors while reading and writing CVs
</UL>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.


<P>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <P>We are very pleased to announce that the 1.9 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.0" available for download today. -->

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

(None!)

<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

<P>
The NCE support has been revamped so that "NCE USB" is a new choice in the preferences window.
Note that this support is still experimental, and will likely evolve as NCE adds features to the adapter.

<P>This version of JMRI no longer supports NCE AIU broadcasts.  This change was needed so that JMRI could reliably read certain CV values. We recommend that if you use NCE AIUs, that you upgrade the command station EPROM to version 2007 or newer and turn off AIU broadcasts.  Code has been added to detect if AIU broadcasts are enabled, and a warning message will appear at startup requesting that AIU broadcasts be turned off for proper operation of the JMRI programs.

<P>This version of JMRI requires Java 1.3 or later.  
To see JMRI's plans for which Java versions will be required when, please
see our
<A HREF="../doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technological roadmap page</a>.

<P>For Lenz users: There are now separate choices for each of the serial-based Lenz Computer Interfaces 
(i.e. the LI100,LI100F,LI101F). Since release 1.7.3, to aid in backwards compatibility, all the interfaces 
currently have the same options as far as port speed is concerned. 
Eventually, the port speeds which are not supported by each interface WILL be removed. 
If you're using one of the interfaces listed above with this release, please check your configuration 
and select the correct device-specific option. There is no impact for LIUSB users with this change.

<P>We have added additional information to the roster files to help properly handle short/long addressing 
in systems that allow low addresses (e.g. 65) to be either short or long addresses. 
The only current system we support that has this capability is NCE.
If you have an NCE system, and you have locomotives with addresses of 127 or less,
you should open their roster entries in DecoderPro, check that the proper short or long address is selected, and save them again.

<P>Indexed CVs will not be included in any printouts for this release.
 
<P>QSI CV 56.129 Engine ID Access is not supported in this release.
  
<P>While programming QSI decoders in Ops mode, it is necessary to disable CV 62 QSI Control (Verbal Acknowledgement), 
otherwise the writes will fail.
 
<P>QSI CV 64 CV Numeric Verbal Readout currently does not work for indexed CVs.
 
<P>The beginnings of support for the QSI Programmer device are present, but it's not complete yet

<h3>Changes since test version 1.9.2:</h3>

<P>
Dan Boudreau has done more work on the NCE USB support

<P>
David Duchamp has added single crossover turnouts and an optional grid to Layout Editor

<P>
Handling of hardware and software fast clocks has been updated by David Duchamp, with help from Ken Cameron

<p>
Fixed a bug that prevented adding a "Ops Mode Programmer" button in the advanced preferences.

<p>
The help system search is working again.

<p>
Added a sample script (<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/jython/AD4OnOff.py">jython/AD4OnOff.py</a>) that gives you a checkbox on the screen to turn on and off local control of AD4-connected turnouts.

<p>
Dick Bronson provided new sounds, icons and backgrounds for use in creating USS CTC panels. Particularly interesting are the images in the resources/icons/USS/background/ folder, with which you can build up a realistic USS CTC panel of any (reasonable) size.

<p>
Dan Boudreau has updated the throttle to have functions up to F28. The popup menu on each function button lets you configure which function is on which button.

<p>
The EasyDCC system now provides a CommandStation interface.  This is mostly an internal thing, but we thought you might want to know.

<p>
When adding backgrounds in the panel editor, the file chooser now remembers where you left it, which makes it easier to build backgrounds from the "slices" that Dick Bronson provided.  Also, backgrounds are added at the specified X, Y location, so you can precisely position the slices.  The default is now 0,0, and can be set via properties.

<p>
So that parts of the program can respond when a C/MRI node goes offline, sensors defined on a C/MRI node are set to UNKNOWN if the program loses contact with that node and has to reinitialize it.
