      Release Notes for JMRI 1.7.3 test release
      </H2>

	<p>Date: MM NN, 2005</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 1.7.3 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<P>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go back to an earlier version.

<P>This is the next in a series of test versions that contain long-awaited new features, particularly improved support for QSI decoders, wait cursors in the programmer, and significant internal updates.  Some of the changes involved are quite extensive, and may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<P>This test version contains important fixes for users programming QSI decoders and Digitrax boards in the PM, BDL and SE series.

<h3>New warnings for this test version:</h3>

<P>We have added additional information to the roster files in this version to help properly handle short/long addressing in systems that allow low addresses (e.g. 65) to be either short or long addresses. The only current system we support that has this capability is NCE.  If you have an NCE system, and you have locomotives with addresses of 127 or less, you should open their roster entries in DecoderPro, check that the proper short or long address is selected,  and save them again.

<h3>Older warnings from this series of test versions:</h3>

<P>Indexed CVs will not be included in any printouts for this release.
 
<P>QSI CVs 56.4, 56.10, and 56.12 may or may not be supported by a particular model but are included in the "Indexed CVs" tab.  Reading or writing these CVs, if not supported, will result in a programmer timeout and the value state will indicate "unknown".
 
<P>QSI CV 56.129 Engine ID Access is not supported in this release.
 
<P>QSI CVs 56.255_0, 56.255_1, and 56.255_2 are write only CVs and are intended to used in Ops mode only as they produce a verbal response. These are included in the Indexed CVs tab.
 
<P>While programming QSI decoders in Ops mode, it is necessary to disable CV 62 QSI Control (Verbal Acknowledgement), otherwise the writes will fail.
 
<P>QSI CV 64 CV Numeric Verbal Readout currently does not work for indexed CVs.
 
<P>The function of the first four outputs of QSI decoders can not be changed in this release although version 6 decoders support this functionality.

<h3>Changes since test version 1.7.3:</h3>

<P>David Duchamp fixed a bug that caused problems when the serial port that the program was expecting wasn't available at startup.

<P>Bob Jacobsen has updated the PRICOM Pocket Tester support. There are now both "monitor" windows to see the time history of the data as it comes from the unit, plus a "table" that allows you to see the most recent packets of a particular type or for a particular address.  You can also see the monitor for just the packets to a particular address. It's also been internationalized, so it would be easy for somebody to translate it to another language. 

<P>Paul Bender has fixed a problem that would sometimes make the speed slider not appear in the throttle tool.  He has also improved the way that a control-click (right click, etc) in the speed section of the throttle gets you access to the alternate method of setting speeds.
