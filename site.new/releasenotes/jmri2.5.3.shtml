      Release Notes for JMRI 2.5.3 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2009</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.5.3 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the first in a new series of test versions.

It contains 
many new features, including:


<ul>
	<LI>
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.


<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.5 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.6" available for download today. -->

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>


<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

<p>JMRI now requires Java 1.5 or later.
If you are using an older version of Java, please
<a href="http://www.sun.com/getjava">upgrade your Java installation</a>.  
To see JMRI's future plans for this and other compatibility issues, please see the JMRI
<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technology roadmap</a>.

<p>
The way you drag things in the Layout Editor has changed if you
are using a Linux computer. 

<p>
Windows desktop shortcuts have been restructured to make them more reliable.
If you have custom shortcuts (ones you made), you may have to update them.
The JMRI-created ones will be updated automatically.  Users of Mac OS X and Linux
will not be effected by this change.
