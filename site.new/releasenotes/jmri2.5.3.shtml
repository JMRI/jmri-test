      Release Notes for JMRI 2.5.3 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2009</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.5.3 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the first in a new series of test versions.

It contains 
many new features, including:


<ul>
	<LI>
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.


<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.5 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.6" available for download today. -->

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</p></b>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

JMRI 2.5.3 uses a new version of the Log4J library, and 
several additional libraries.  If you've written your own
Java code using JMRI, or have your own startup scripts, you
might have to make some changes to adapt to these new libraries.
If you don't get messages about missing or deprecated methods,
you don't have to worry about this.

<p>


<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

Starting in JMRI 2.5.2, Logix support has a lot of
new capabilities, but panel files that use these capabilities
can't be read by previous versions of the program. 
Please keep backup copies of your panel files in case you
want to move back to a previous version.

<p>
Starting in JMRI 2.5.2, 
there have been extensive changes to the way JMRI installs and starts on Windows.
If you have custom shortcuts (ones you made), you may have to update them.
The JMRI-created ones will be updated automatically.  Users of Mac OS X and Linux
will not be affected by this change.

<p>
The downloads are significantly larger due to more text and images
in the help pages, especially the updated manual.

<p>JMRI now requires Java 1.5 or later.
If you are using an older version of Java, please
<a href="http://www.sun.com/getjava">upgrade your Java installation</a>.  
To see JMRI's future plans for this and other compatibility issues, please see the JMRI
<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technology roadmap</a>.

<p>
Starting in JMRI 2.5.1,
the way you drag things in the Layout Editor has changed if you
are using a Linux computer.

<h3>Changes since test version 2.5.2:</h3>

Simon Ginsburg has updated the German translation.

<p>
Various improvements to help screens

<p>
Ian Birchenough provided a definition for the Bachmann 3 function decoder.

<p>
Dan Boudreau added more help pages on operations, and 
resized some figures so they take less screen and disk space.

<p>
Some pages in the help system link to pages on other web sites.
The help viewer isn't a full-function web browser, so these pages
don't always display well, PDF files can't be displayed, etc.
Starting in JMRI 2.5.3, if you have Java 1.6 or later installed, 
your native web browser will be launched to display these pages.

<p>
If you run into a problem with JMRI, and the people trying to help
you need more information, you can 
"<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/mailreport/Report.shtml">send a problem report</a>"
(from the Help menu)
that contains information about your JMRI and Java versions, configuration, error messages, etc.
Developers can then look at that to get the information they need to help find a solution.
This feature is still in development, and might not work with all
email systems yet.

<p>
The Log4J library used by JMRI has been updated to the current version.
This won't change the user experience, but helps us handle errors in a cleaner way.
Dan Boudreau did 1300+ updates using this!

<p>
Pete Cressman improved error handling in the sensor group GUI.

<p>
More help files.  Also, some help pages were reformatted to be more readable,
and image files were reformatted to save some space.

<p>
Fixed a problem that was making some buttons disappear when editing
Digitrax SPJ sound projects. Fixed a problem when editing the SDF
control sequence in SPJ projects that used certain looping options.
Added more editing capabilities for SDF instructions.

<p>
Dan Boudreau updated the operations feature to 
allow users to place and resize the Settings, Edit Location, Trains, and Edit Trains windows.

<p>
We have again changed the references to the XLST transform in 
newly written panel files, trying to get the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/apps/PanelPro/ShowPanel.shtml">browser display</a> to work by default.
