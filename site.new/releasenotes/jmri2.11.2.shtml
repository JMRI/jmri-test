Signal Masts now have Lit and Held properties

<p>
Dan Boudreau fixed several problems and added some new features to operations:
<ul>
<li>Fixed a build problem when a staging track didn't have an engine, and the staging track name was the same as another in a different location.
<li>Fixed two minor bugs, lead car in kernel wasn't always saved correctly, cars in a kernel didn't always have a proper destination and track.
<li>Fixed a problem with cabooses going to wrong track in staging when there wasn't an engine assigned to the train.
<li>New feature, "Timetable" under Trains->Tools.  Allows you to quickly set which trains will run on any given day of the week.

<p>
When identifying a decoder type, DecoderPro is now smarter about displaying a partial match.
