<h3>Changes since test version 2.11.1</h3>

Chuck Catania contributed a new set of 
SPTCO-1930 signal aspects.

<p>
Andrew Crosland improved the speed averaging for the Bachrus speedometer.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson updated the auto width justification of a memory label in LayoutEditor, around the x position, 
ie the text will centre around position X, or be right justified to the value of X.
Before the justification only really showed itself with fixed width memory labels.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson made multiple improvements to panel editor.
<ul>
<li>Multiple items can be selected, by holding down the ctrl key and clicking on them.
<li>Selected items now have a square box drawn around them.
<li>Positioning can now be adjusted by using the arrow keys, the arrow keys on their own will move the items by 5 pixels either way, 
    by holding shift and then the arrow key, it will move a pixel at a time.
<li>Provides a basic copy & paste function within a single panel, allows for single or multiple items to be copied.
<li>A revised pop-up menu is displayed when multiple items are selected, it only displays the options for Edit Alignment, Remove, Copy.
<li>Should also remove the issue in ubuntu when dragging items on the panel editor, that the popupbox is displayed when it shouldn't be. 
    Nb this needs to be check on a MAC that it doesn't cause a problem.
</ul>

<p>
Kevin Dickerson improved the preferences:
    By default 4 sets of jmrixconfigpanes are created at start up.  
    However if there are more than 4 connections, the 5th and above connections do not have a jmrixconfigpane instance created and 
    do not automatically get listed in the preference window.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson fixed a problem that could cause multiple LocoNet connections to get the wrong prefix.

<p>
Andrew Crosland improved the Bachrus speedometer readout to work more closely with the hardware, and to reject measurements that appear to suffer from jitter.

<p>
Pete Cressman added a copy popup to the Control Panel Editor.

<p>
Paul Bender is updating the XPressNet adapter code to allow multiple connections.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson made it possible to dismiss a print preview dialog.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson updated roster printing: 
Puts the loco icon on the print out, formats the text around the graphic so it looks neater and doesn't run into the loco graphic.
Function Labels can now be printed on individual roster items.
When printing individual roster items, the user is given the option to select which tabs should be printed.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson updated the layout editor:
Add the ability to set the background color of the panel via a menu option.
Selected items now have a square box drawn around them.
Multiple items can be selected, by holding down the ctrl key and clicking on them.
Positioning can now be adjusted by using the arrow keys, the arrow keys on their own will move the items by 5 pixels either way, 
by holding shift and then the arrow key, it will move a pixel at a time.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson updated the Panel Editor & Control Editor:
Added ability to set the background colour by bring up the popup menu on an empty part of the panel. 

<p>
Andrew Crosland updated the SPROG support to make repeated ops mode CV writes appear consecutively rather than interleaved.
Problem reported on developers list by Galen Seitz 22 July 2010

<p>
Andrew Crosland updated the Bachrus speedometer to add dial type speed display, in both metric and English units,
and to
integrate with DCC system to capture loco speed profile. You can now export a speed curve to a .csv file.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson made some improvements to the connection code, including catching an error, removing deprecated code and 
adding a "disable adapter" option.

<p>
Pete Cressman improved how icons are found in the computer's file system.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson changed the editors so you don't have to hold the control key down while moving items.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson updated memory labels to set the auto width justification of a memory label around the x position, 
ie the text will centre around position X, or be right justified to the value of X.
Before the justification only really showed itself with fixed width memory labels.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson placed the select items to print option, prior to selecting the printer.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson provided a "Properties" window for text based items, which
allows the user to set various text based settings in the popup menu from a single window all at once, 
(eg Font Size, Color, Background, style, border margins etc) and preview them prior to applying the changes.
Also allows for the user to enter in font sizes that are not listed in the popup.
For texted based sensors, it is possible to preview and configure the text for the four different states.
Initial development of the feature, will need some further refinement, 
only available with the panel editor, 
but can be used in the other editors once any issues have been ironed out.
Feature request 2958431 relates.

<p>
Andrew Crosland added help pages for the Bachrus speedometer.

Simon Ginsburg made a huge update to the JMRI translations into other languages.

<p>

When Empty" is now available. When a car's load changes to empty, the
car can optionally return to a location or location/track. UK support

<li>Improved "save throttle layout" and "save default throttle layout", now also save throttles themselves, new preference in throttle preference to configure this behavior (activated as default, to be deactivated to go to older mode that would only save the windows layout).
</ul>
