      Release Notes for JMRI 1.9.4 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, YYYY</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 1.9.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions.
It contains 
many new features, including:
<ul>
<li>several decoder definitions were added and improved,
<li>JMRI throttles can now address decoder functions up to number 28,
<li>improved fast clock support,
<li>additions to the layout editor,
<li>additional sounds and graphics for creating USS CTC panels,
<li>lots of additions to the help screens
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.


<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 1.9 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.0" available for download today. -->

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</p></b>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<p>
The starting location of file chooser windows used to determine which file to 
open or where to save a file have been updated to (hopefully) more useful initial places.  They now retain their location from one use to the next, so you don't have to keep navigating back to the same place.  Please let us know (via a comment on the jmriusers list) if these two changes are an improvement or not.

<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

<p>
The NCE support has been revamped so that "NCE USB" is a new choice in the preferences window. Note that this support is still experimental, and will likely evolve as NCE adds features to the adapter.

<p>This version of JMRI no longer supports NCE AIU broadcasts. This change was needed so that JMRI could reliably read certain CV values. We recommend that if you use NCE AIUs, that you upgrade the command station EPROM to version 2007 or newer and turn off AIU broadcasts. Code has been added to detect if AIU broadcasts are enabled, and a warning message will appear at startup requesting that AIU broadcasts be turned off for proper operation of the JMRI programs.

<p>This version of JMRI requires Java 1.3 or later.  To see JMRI's plans for which Java versions will be required when, please see our
<A HREF="../doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technological roadmap page</a>.

<p>Indexed CVs will not be included in any printouts for this release.
 
<p>QSI CV 56.129 Engine ID Access is not supported in this release.
  
<p>While programming QSI decoders in Ops mode, it is necessary to disable CV 62 QSI Control (Verbal Acknowledgement), otherwise the writes will fail.
 
<p>QSI CV 64 CV Numeric Verbal Readout currently does not work for indexed CVs.
 
<p>The beginnings of support for the QSI Programmer device are present, but it's not complete yet

<h3>Changes since test version 1.9.3:</h3>

<p>
Fixed a problem connecting to RPS at speeds other than 9600 baud.

<p>
Dan Boudreau made more improvements to the NCE help.

<p>
The RPS code was updated to work with the newest hardware formats.

<p>
Help screen updates by Dick Bronson and Dan Boudreau.

<p>
Ian Birchenough contributed a definition for the ZTC 255 decoder (version 2).

<p>
Dick Bronson updated the decoder definition for the RR-CirKits TC-64 to better handle reset operations.

<p>
The panel editor was changed so that newly added icons for turnouts, sensors, etc are in front of (on top of) previously added ones, instead of the other way around.
Also, newly added icons can be positioned even if the checkbox is set to keep the others fixed.  You can always make an icon movable by opening its popup menu and unchecking the "Fixed" option.

<p>
The build tests were updated to produce less spurious output. If you build your own JMRI version and run the "alltest" target, you shouldn't get any WARN or ERROR messages now.

<p>
The connector information in several decoder definitions was updated based on info contributed via the web site.

<p>
The build file was updated so you can now run profiles within NetBeans.

<p>
A rarely-encountered bug with Lights on Oak Tree hardware was fixed. 

<p>
David Duchamp and Ken Cameron fixed a problem which caused the NCE fast clock to be reset erroneously.
