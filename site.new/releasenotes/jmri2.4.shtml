<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

Linux users, especially Ubuntu users, of Panel Editor and Layout Editor 
may experience trouble with displaying popup menus and  
repositioning items on their panels.  This is a known problem that is  
being worked on. It is expected to be fixed in an early 2.5.x test  
version.

<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

Windows desktop shortcuts have been restructured to make them more reliable.
If you have custom shortcuts (ones you made), you may have to update them.
The JMRI-created ones will be updated automatically.  Users of Mac OS X and Linux
will not be effected by this change.

<p>
Starting with the 2.3.4 test release, by default JMRI is allowed to use
up to 200MB of memory (up from a limit of 60MB or 64MB previously).
If this is more memory than you have available, and you notice JMRI
slowing down a lot, please let us know so we can provide a work-around.
<p>
Staring with the 2.3.3 test release, JMRI builds the classpath (the
list of .jar libraries used by the program) dynamically on Windows.  
We'll use this in the future for plug-ins and other features, and
other platforms have been doing this for a while.
If you have added any .jar files to your JMRI program directory, they
may cause problems when the program is starting.  Also, if originally
installed a very old version of JMRI, there might still be files around
that can cause this problems.
If so, you can fix it by moving aside those extra
.jar files from the JMRI program directory, or by asking Windows to un-install JMRI,
before reruning the installer.
For more information on this, please see this
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/message/35065">discussion</a>
on the 
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/">jmriusers mailing list</a>.

<p>JMRI is moving toward requiring Java 1.5 or later.  Certain new features may not work if you are using an earlier
version of Java.  To see JMRI's future plans for this and other compatibility issues, please see the JMRI
<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technology roadmap</a>.

<p>JMRI no longer supports NCE AIU broadcasts. This change was needed so that JMRI could reliably read certain CV values. 
We recommend that if you use NCE AIUs, that you upgrade the command station EPROM to version 2007 or newer and turn off AIU broadcasts. 
Code has been added to detect if AIU broadcasts are enabled, and if so a warning message will appear at startup requesting that AIU broadcasts be turned off for proper operation of the JMRI programs.

<p>Indexed CVs will not be included in any printouts for this release.
 
<p>QSI CV 56.129 Engine ID Access is not supported in this release.
  
<p>While programming QSI decoders in Ops mode, it is necessary to disable CV 62 QSI Control (Verbal Acknowledgement), otherwise the writes will fail.
 
<p>QSI CV 64 CV Numeric Verbal Readout currently does not work for indexed CVs.

<h3>Changes since test version 2.3.8:</h3>

Paul Bender added a work-around a couple of Elite Specific throttle issues:
<ol>
<li>The Hornby Elite does not send out a message indicating another throttle h
as taken control.  The code now polls the command station every 5 seconds 
to get the current status of the throttle.
<li>The Throttle information response messages sent by the Hornby Elite 
always indicate the throttle is in 14 speed step mode and the 
locomotive is part of an MU.  
Ignore the speed step setting so we do not reset the software throttle 
to 14 speed steps and loose control of the train.  
Note:  This requires the user to change the speed step setting in the 
throttle if using a mode other than the default (the default is 128 speed step mode).
</ol>

<p>
Dan Boudreau made a number of improvements to the operations code.

<p>
Paul Bender updated the throttle to fix a problem with mismatched speed steps.

<p>
Chris Zurek added a new MRC 1662 definition, 
and updated the MRC 1666 definition to include more info on bells and horn.

<p>
Kem Cameron fixed a problem in the X10 support that was preventing the 16th device from working.
