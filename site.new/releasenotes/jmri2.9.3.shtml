	<p>Date: MMM NN, 2010</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.9.3 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the third in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.10 (or perhaps JMRI 3.0) production release in Summer 2010. 

<p>
It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>
<li>
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</p></b>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

This version of JMRI uses the new communications libraries introduced in 
<a href="jmri2.9.2.shtml">JMRI 2.9.2</a>.
On Windows, the installer should take care of all installation and deinstallation 
required.  On Mac, no actions are necessary, the new distribution directory
should just work.  On Linux, you may have to install and/or uninstall 
various communications library parts, see the
<a href="../install/Linux.html">JMRI Linux pages</a> for more info.

<p>
The JInput USB library was updated to the current version in 
<a href="jmri2.9.1.shtml">JMRI 2.9.1</a>, which (should) 
have fixed problems on
Windows Visata, Intel Macs and some Linux machines.  We don't have a way to check this with all possible
input devices, so please check to make sure that your USB-attached devices still work.

<p>
When loading an older panel file containing signal head icons, you may
get WARN messages about "did not locate lunar icon file" and "did not locate flashlunar icon file".
To make these stop, just store the file again so that it's rewritten in the most recent format.
