      Release Notes for JMRI 2.9.4 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM NN, 2010</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.9.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the fourth in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.10 (or perhaps JMRI 3.0) production release in Summer 2010. 

<p>
It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</p></b>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

If you're using a Lenz XPressNet connection, please
uncheck the "Check Buffer Status" box in the preference
pane where you selected the Lenz protocol.

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

This version of JMRI uses the new communications libraries introduced in 
<a href="jmri2.9.3.shtml">JMRI 2.9.3</a>.
On Windows, the installer should take care of all installation and deinstallation 
required.  On Mac, no actions are necessary, the new distribution directory
should just work.  On Linux, you may have to install and/or uninstall 
various communications library parts, see the
<a href="../install/Linux.html">JMRI Linux pages</a> for more info.
<p>
You may get some messages like:
<code><pre>
WARNING:  RXTX Version mismatch
        Jar version = RXTX-2.2pre1
        native lib Version = RXTX-2.2pre2
</pre></code>
For now, this should be considered normal.  We'll try to get it
removed before the next production release.

<p>
The JInput USB library was updated to the current version in 
<a href="jmri2.9.1.shtml">JMRI 2.9.1</a>, which (should) 
have fixed problems on
Windows Visata, Intel Macs and some Linux machines.  We don't have a way to check this with all possible
input devices, so please check to make sure that your USB-attached devices still work.

<p>
When loading an older panel file containing signal head icons, you may
get WARN messages about "did not locate lunar icon file" and "did not locate flashlunar icon file".
To make these stop, just store the file again so that it's rewritten in the most recent format.

<h3>Changes since test version 2.9.3</h3>

Kevin Dickerson fixed a problem editing signal logic that had been introduced in JMRI 2.9.1.

<p>
Dick Bronson updated the SP 1960 signal definitions.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added a new feature added to a turnout on the layout panel, 
that prevents the turnout from being changed on the panel 
if the blocks on the connecting path through the turnout are occupied, 
thus helping to prevent accidental changing of turnouts when they are occupied.  
Feature is disabled by default.

<p>
Fixed a problem that prevented clicking on panels in the mini web server.

<p>
Dick Bronson improved the SP signal definitions

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added a "signal group" feature, still in development.

<p>
Many decoder files got small fixes so that they were entirely in the proper
format.

<p>
Lionel Jeanson updated the USBThrottle so it now supports browsing through rosters and selecting one.

<p>
Lionel Jeanson provided a bug fix in wiimote throttle.

<p>
Many decoder definitions where changed over to use "XML Schema" instead of "DTDs" for their
syntax checking.  This is a technical, internal change that will allow some other
updates later.

<p>
Paul Bender add support for the Power manager to the Lenz XPressNet simulator.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson updated the preferences manager to show icons in warning/info dialogs,
and to give more options to suppressing messages permanently or just this session.

<p>
The 
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/web/index.shtml">Mini Web Server</a>
can now display more types of information, including directory listings, 
and better show the contents of JMRI XML files.

<p>
Dan Boudreau fixed a problem in the "Apps" infrastructure that caused it to 
initialize twice.

<p>
Update of the SRCP server.

<p>
Andrew Berridge improves the XBox remote throttle.

<p>
Dan Boudreau changed the check of operations train names to be case-independent,
because Windows file names are case-indepedent: "First" and "first" conflict.

<p>
By suggestion of Jim Betz, locomotive roster entries now show the last date they were
stored.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson made a number of changes to the way that JMRI works with the ecos, 
mainly in the handling of roster entries and the ecos database.

<p>
The panel editor and layout editor code has been extensively reworked. It's not
intended that this cause any changes in how it appears to look to the user, but
please let us know if you see any.

<p>
Bob Coleman updated the powerline insteon 2412s support.
Catch reply message 50 (echo from a repeater) and clean up console output a bit
Via an insteon 2412s an X10 device or a registered insteon device should turn on or off.
Dim does not work yet.  Sensors do not work yet.  Just tested using Light table.
Sometimes first commands to an insteon device fail -- once they have been retried they work.
Note that Insteon devices must be registered to work.

<p>
Andrew Berridge made a small correction to the BLI Blueline decoder definition.

<p>
A problem that would occasionally cause a LocoNet-connected Double Output or Triple
Output signal head to now show the most recent appearance.  The fix doesn't effect
SE8c or non-LocoNet signal heads, so any problems with those should still be reported.

<p>
The roster now includes the date and time that the entry was last saved, as reported
by the computer on which it was saved. No checking of this value is done.

<p>
david zuhn updated the Linux start-up scripts.

<p>
Fixed a bug in the way Roster populates the various selected combo boxes.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added "invert" to SPROG-driven turnouts.

<p>
Matt Harris updated the Windows launch script to properly handle mixed systems
with 32-bit Java on 64-bit Windows.

<p>
Many improvements to the built-in
<a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/html/web/index.shtml">mini web server</a>,
including improvements to iPhone support and allowing more browser types to
display JMRI panel files.

<p>
The communications library issues that prevented JMRI 2.9.3 from being used
on Mac OS X 1o.4 has been fixed.

<p>
Help system now can directly print help pages. See the new icons
at the top of any help screen. Also, you can know mark a page as
a "favorite" and easily come back to it later.

<p>
Jason M'Sadoques improved the WiThrottle support to pick the best
IP address for display when several are present, and to not 
display internal-only addresses that won't work for external access.

<p>
David Duchamp updated the instructions for building with XCode.

<p>
Dan Boudreau improved the operations train icon:  
Popup menu now always displays the "Throttle" option.  
"Throttle" is disabled if roster entry doesn't exist for the loco.
