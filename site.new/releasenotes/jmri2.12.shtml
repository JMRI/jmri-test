      Release Notes for JMRI 2.12 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2011</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Production release 2.12 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<!-- <br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b> -->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

We are very pleased to announce that the 2.11 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a
version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.
We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.12" available for download today.

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

(None yet)

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

Development Version 2.11.4 contains significant improvements to the Powerline Interfaces. 
Some of these improvements involved a complete restructuring of the underlying code. 
As a result, previously working Preferences may now show no connections for some of the Powerline Interfaces. 
If this occurs, go to Preferences and setup the Powerline Layout Connections again. 
Then save the Preferences and restart JMRI.

<p>In Development Version 2.11.3 JMRI instituted a more robust and
transparent system for handling missing panel icon files. If missing
icon files are discovered during the panel loading process this system
presents a dialog box that allows the user to either delete the
offending reference or use the file browser to find the proper location.
Older versions of JMRI didn't always fully remove the references to
deleted panel icons. Panels which contain these stray references will
present the dialog box during the first panel load. If the panel worked
fine before, simply choose the delete option for each "missing" icon
presented to remove the stray references. Once the panel has finished
loading, save/store the panel file, quit JMRI and then reload. As a
precaution, we recommend either making a backup copy of your panel file
before diving in or saving the modified file under a different name</p>

<p>There have been extensive changes to the throttle code. If you
have written scripts that use throttles, particularly multiple
throttles, please check to make sure they still work.</p>

<p>The numerical values of "ON" and "OFF" for Lights changed in JMRI
2.11.2, along with some of the other constants in the class. This will
have no impact on people just using the program. If you're using scripts
with numerical values in them, please recode them to use the symbolic
values.</p>

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

None at the time of this release.

<h3>Changes since production release 2.10</h3>

<p>Dan Boudreau made many enhancements to operations.</p>
<ul>
	<LI>Changed the track type "siding" to "spur" to better represent
	a track that serves an industry.</LI>
	<li>The operations program now supports car routing. The program
	will now use up to 5 trains to move a car from one location to another.
	Routing through staging tracks is disabled by default.</li>
	<li>A new feature, "Return When Empty" is now available. When a
	car's load changes to empty, the car can optionally return to a
	location or location/track.</li>
	<li>UK support been improved.</li>
	<li>Improved the build report messages.</li>
	<li>You can now specify a set out or pick up comment for a car based
	on the car's load.</li>
	<li>You can now mark a car as misplaced. When a car is marked
	misplaced, the program will not attempt to move the car. Also a list of
	misplaced cars is now appended to manifests and switch lists.</li>
	<li>Schedules can now delay a car's pick up from a spur.</li>
	<li>New feature, car loads can now have a low or high priority.
	High priority loads are serviced before low priority loads.</li>
	<li>New feature, "Timetable" under Trains-&gt;Tools. Allows you to
	quickly set which trains will run on any given day of the week.</li>
	<li>New tool "Routes-&gt;Tools-&gt;Set Train Icons Coordinates", you can
	now visually update train icon coordinates for all locations.</li>
	<li>New tool "Route-&gt;Tools-&gt;Set Train Icons Coordinates for this
	Route", you can now visually update train icon coordinates for a route.</li>
	<li>New route feature. You can now specify additional wait time
	in a route. This allows you to adjust a train's manifest arrival times
	to your liking.</li>
	<li>New route feature. You can now set a departure time anywhere
	in a route. Nice feature for passenger trains!</li>
	<li>New route feature. You can now add an optional comment to each
	stop in a route. Comments will show up in your manifests.</li>
	<li>You can now decide to print location comments on the train's
	manifests. See Trains-&gt;Tools-&gt;Print Options.</li>
	<li>New build option, "Settings-&gt;Tools-&gt;Options". You can
	now allow local switcher moves between spurs, yards, and interchanges.</li>
	<li>You can now configure if staging tracks are restrictive.
	Default is restrictive. Option is under Settings-&gt;Tools-&gt;Options. See help for
	more info.</li>
	<li>New operations panel feature, you can now move a train anywhere
	in the route via the train icon popup menu. Select Route in the popup
	menu, then the next location desired.</li>
	<li>Improved the way the code handles switching from descriptive
	to AAR car types.</li>
	<li>You can now use a text editor to preview a train's build
	report. Unfortunately, this feature requires java 1.6. and is currently
	disabled for general release. Contact Dan Boudreau by email if you want
	a jmri.jar file that has this feature.</li>
	<li>You can now customize the order in which loco and car
	attributes are printed on manifests and switch lists.</li>
	<li>A train's total weight calculation is now based on whether the
	cars are loaded or empty.</li>
	<li>You can now define a car as being a passenger car. A
	passenger car's weight doesn't change with load. Passenger cars are
	placed towards the rear of a train.</li>
	<li>Add some additional fonts for operations.</li>
	<li>You can now modify and save column widths for the Cars and
	Engines tables.</li>
	<li>New tools to print trains and locations by car types. See Tools under "Modify Trains/Locations by Car Type";</li>
	<li>The program now allow passenger cars to return to their starting location.</li>
	<li>You can now change a track's type (Spur, Yard or Interchange).
	Use the track "Tools-&gt;ChangeTrackType".</li>
	<li>You can now specify the year you're modeling. To enter the year that
	you're modeling, use the Settings window.</li>
	<li>You can now modify the train timetable.</li>
	<li>Changed switch list valid date to 24 hour clock</li>
	<li>Code now checks the train's direction when determining a track
	for locos and cabooses.</li>

	<li>Add to train tool menu print and preview build report.</li>
	<li>Allow user to change departure comment to show loads and
	empties.</li>
	<li>You can now control which loads a track can service.</li>
	<li>Added tabbed manifest and switch lists, see Settings Tools-&gt;Print Options:</li>
	<li>Minor enhancement to check the car's load when placing car at
	a location.</li>
	<li>Improve how operations moves cars when a route services a
	location more than once. The program now performs set out first followed by pick ups.</li>
	<li>All car loads in a kernel are now updated by spur's
	schedule.</li>
	<li>You can now change all of the loads in a kernel when editing
	a car's load.</li>
	<li>Update "Show Car Types Serviced" Tool for train, now shows
	load status for train and track.</li>
	<li>Operations enhancement, in the Trains window, user can select
	"Show All" or "Show only build trains".</li>
	<li>Operations enhancement, now the user can sort trains by
	status.</li>
	<li>The program now modifies all cars in kernel when using custom
	loads from staging.</li>
	<li>You can now preview or print out the car loads for the
	various car types. This feature can be found in the Edit Car
	Loads-&gt;Tools</li>
	<li>You can now control which staging track a train will use.  You can also have
	the program prompt you for a departure track from staging.  See Settings Tools-&gt;Options.</li>
	<li>Provided a new operations sample script to deselect the train
	build button when a train terminates: OperationsDeselectBuild.py</li>
	<li>Users can now run scripts after operation files have been
	loaded, and users can run scripts when the Trains window is closed.</li>
	<li>The program now checks car and loco length field during file
	imports.</li>
	<li>You can now select where to place the backup operations
	files. See Settings Tools-&gt;Backups and Restore.</li>
	<li>The program now routes cars from staging with a custom load to
	a spur with a schedule demanding that car type and load.</li>
	<li>When printing car locations you can now optionally have a
	space or page break after each set of locations.</li>
	<li>New manifest print option, you can now show destination and
	track when picking up a car.</li>
	<li>Schedules can now operate in two modes, sequential or match.
	Use match mode when you don't care about car order.</li>
	<li>New optional train requirements, you can now have two
	locomotive changes in the train's route, or request helper service.</li>
	<li>Cars with a final destination will no longer wander if the
	destination track doesn't have space for the car.</li>
	<li>The edit schedule destination track menu now shows only valid
	tracks. Staging tracks are no longer shown in the edit schedule window.</li>
	<li>The program will now check the entire schedule in match mode
	when generating custom loads from staging.</li>
	<li>The switch list "Print Switch List Changes" now only shows new
	trains since the last printing.</li>
	<li>New "Set Cars" tool. Now you can set the location,
	destinations, and load for a group of cars.</li>
	<li>New car sort in the cars window, by car's final destination.</li>
	<Li>New operations feature. You can now optionally create a Comma
	Separated Values (csv) manifest file. Now you can use Excel to create a
	custom manifest to your liking. Files can be found in
	operations-&gt;csvManifests</Li>
	<li>A new capacity check has been added to limit overloading of a
	spur with a schedule in aggressive mode. Overloading a spur can
	still happen when using aggressive mode, but the overloading is now
	limited.</li>
	<Li>Enhancement. A car in a kernel with FRED must be the lead (*)
	car. When editing car with FRED and in kernel, the program will
	automatically make the car the lead.</Li>
	<li>Manifests and switch lists now block cars by kernel. The new
	blocking order is: first by road, then number, kernel, location and
	finally destination. This should keep cars in a kernel together on the
	manifest and switch lists.</li>
	<li>You can now change the loco and car manifest and switch list
	pick up and set out prefixes, i.e. " [ ] Pick up". See
	Setting-&gt;Tools Print Options.</li>
	<li>You can now reset a train directly from the Trains window.</li>
	<li>You can now have operations windows close on save. See
	Settings Options.</li>
	<LI>Enhancement to the "Set Cars" tool. You can now ignore
	selected fields when changing a group of cars.</LI>
	<LI>You can now optionally select which trains can set out and
	pick up cars from a spur.</LI>
	<LI>Car routing enhancement, program now checks the number of
	available moves when determining if a train can service a car.</LI>
	<LI>Improved how the program set outs cars when there's two or
	more stops at the same location. There is now a bias to set out the
	cars at the earlier stop.</LI>
	<LI>New schedules enhancement, uses can optionally control a
	schedule using the train timetables. For example you can now deliver a
	car to a spur based on the day of the week.</LI>
	<LI>The trains window now shows which timetable is active.</LI>
	<LI>Spur/schedule enhancement. When a car is placed at a spur
	with a schedule the car's destination isn't immediately set, only the
	car's final destination. This should eliminate overloading at spurs
	with schedules when in aggressive mode.</LI>
	<LI>Car forwarding enhancement when a car has a final destination.
	Now when the destination track is full, the program will determine if a
	yard track at the destination is available, and deliver the car to the
	yard track. The car will remain at the yard track until the spur
	becomes available.</LI>
	<LI>The program will now warn you if you haven't saved your files
	before doing a backup.</LI>
	<LI>You can now use the wild card "*" when using the "Find" button
	in the cars and locomotives windows. For example, if you wanted to find
	all cars with road numbers that ended with 456, you would enter *456.</LI>
	<LI>Fixed a problem when a spur has a schedule and a group of
	cars (kernel) was placed at the spur. Sometimes the car load wasn't
	updated properly. Thank-you Frank Wyatt for bring this to our
	attention.</LI>
	<Li>Changed the order of the location comment when there's no work
	at a location. The location and route comments now come after the "No
	work statement".</Li>
	<LI>Added some additional comments in the build report with
	regards to car routing. Messages are now in the build report. Messages
	to the console have been removed.</LI>
	<LI>Fixed a problem with switch lists showing loco pick ups when
	there wasn't. This happened when the switch list was printed when the
	locos were at that location.</LI>
	<LI>New feature, train logging. In addition to car and loco
	logging, the program can now log train activity.</LI>
	<LI>Operations manifest and switch lists enhancement, users can
	now specify local car message format and color, see Print Options for
	details.</LI>
	<LI>Program now remembers a car's previous final destination when
	reseting a train. Now when you reset a train and the car destinations
	that were set by a schedule will remain.</LI>
	<LI>Improved how tracks with setting FIFO and LIFO behave.
	Previously if the program couldn't find a destination for a car, all
	cars behind that car were stuck. Now the program will jump over a car
	that can't move.</LI>
	<LI>Train manifests now correctly show trains length and weight
	when there are loco changes in route.</LI>
	<LI>New feature, you can now enter a cost value for your cars and
	locos. Nothing to do with operations, but nice to have.</LI>
	<LI>You can now delete a schedule directly from the schedules
	window.</LI>
	<LI>You can now specify an alternative track for spurs with
	schedules. See Tools-&gt;Options in the Schedule window.</LI>
	<LI>Improved car import by allowing users the option of having the
	program automatically create new locations and tracks during the car
	import.</LI>
	<LI>Print car and loco roster can now show the value field.</LI>
	<LI>Export car and loco now exports the value field.</LI>
	<LI>Switch lists now show the train's arrival and or departure
	direction.</LI>
	<LI>Improved how custom car loads are generated from staging when
	using match mode, and "Generate custom loads for train spurs serviced
	by this train".</LI>
	<LI>Fixed some of the operations windows so the input text fields
	now work correctly when using large font sizes.</LI>
	<LI>New feature, the ability to pool a set of tracks to share
	their lengths. See under Edit Track, Tools-&gt;Pools.</LI>
