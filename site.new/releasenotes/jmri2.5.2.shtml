	<p>Subject: Test version 2.5.2 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the first in a new series of test versions.

It contains 
many new features, including:


<ul>
	<LI>
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.


<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.5 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.6" available for download today. -->

<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

<p>JMRI now requires Java 1.5 or later.
If you are using an older version of Java, please

<p>
The way you drag things in the Layout Editor has changed if you
are using a Linux computer. 

<p>
Windows desktop shortcuts have been restructured to make them more reliable.
If you have custom shortcuts (ones you made), you may have to update them.
The JMRI-created ones will be updated automatically.  Users of Mac OS X and Linux
will not be effected by this change.

<h3>Changes since test version 2.5.1:</h3>

Fixed some links within help pages.

<p>
Xavier Chazelle provided a new decoder definition for the Uhlenbrock 73400 mini decoder.

<p>
New NMRA manufacturer numbers:
<ul>
    <li>49 - Joka Electronic
    <li>50 - N&amp;Q Electronics
    <li>51 - DCC Supplies, Ltd
</ul>

<p>
Matt Harris improved the Windows startup scripts to 
put the messages.log log file and the Jython cache files
in the JMRI preferences directory. 
This lets JMRI run cleanly on Windows 7.

<p>
Nigel Cliffe and Mark Waters provided new definitions for the
Zimo MX620 decoder.

<p>Dan Boudreau made several enhancements to the operations program. You
can now specify car loads, and define the name of the load received or
shipped for a siding by using the schedule feature. Schedules can now be
accessed from the Locations menu under Tools. You can now also modify
the default load names for empty and loaded.  Edit frames now appear on top
when launched from tables. 

<p>
Matt Harris fixed a problem launching JMRI on a Windows 64-bit machine with
more than 2GB of memory installed.

<p>
Ken Cameron fixed a problem saving the powerline CP290 configuration.

<p>
The Linux startup scripts should now have executable permission set automatically.

<p>
Bob Coleman added Acela Signalhead support.  
Double and Triple will now work, 
but they send individual on and off commands rather 
than more optimal Acela signal commands down to the hardware.
So, added an Acela Aspect option that will do things efficiently 
for Acela and also correctly supports BiPolar and Wigwags.

<p>
Matt Harris made the startup scripts more reliable on Windows 98.

<p>
John Plocher updated the instructions for using Eclipse to build JMRI.

<p>
Andrew Crosland improved the CBUS and CAN utility tools.

<p>
David Duchamp added automatic setting of turnouts to Dispatcher

<p>
Bob Coleman did a lot of important work on improving the JUnit build tests for the operations feature.

<p>
Walter Thompson did a lot of work to improve sample scripts.

<p>
Jack Shall updated the "Lenz 54" decoder definition.

<p>
Tom Starbuck updated and organized the model numbers in the TCS BEMF decoder definitions.

<p>
A bunch more baud rates were added for CAN connections.

<p>
Paul Bender updated the XPressNet support to properly handle non-standard operations by the Hornby Elite. 
He also added a configuriation tool for the Lenz LI-USB.

<p>
Andrew Crosland improved the CBUS support and added a new "Event Table" tool.

<p>
Marc Fournier improved the TCS BEMF decoder definition.

<p>
Peter Ulvestad improved the LnSendTool.py sample script.

<p>
Walt Thompson improved some web pages.

<p>
Mark Waters provided a new Zimo MX640 definition for version 1, 2, 3 and 4 decoders.

<p>
Jack Shall updated the Comprehensive programmer to add some lighting options.

<p>
Dan Boudreau and Mark Schutzer improved the reliability of ops-mode (on the main)
programming when using an NCE system and certain non-NCE decoders

<p>
Ken Cameron updated the Team Digital Sic24 decoder, plus added the Sic24AD version.

<p>
Matt Harris added a decoder definition for versions 41 to 43 of the 
Lenz LE103XF.

<p>
Matt Harris updated the definition for the Digitrax TF4 and TF2
with information from Bob Grosh.

<p>
Jeff Schmaltz updated the Massoth decoder definitions.

<p>
Jeff Schmaltz added additional detail to the Zimo MX69 and MX690 definitions.

<p>
Jeff Schmaltz updated the version numbers for several ESU decoders.

<p>
Mark Waters fixed CV38 in the Zimo MX620 series of decoder definitions,
updated the more recent versions to include additional CVs,
