      Release Notes for JMRI 2.9.5 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM NN, 2010</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.9.5 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the fifth in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.10 (or perhaps JMRI 3.0) production release in Summer 2010. 

<p>
It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>
<li>
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</p></b>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

(none yet)

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

If you're using a Lenz XPressNet connection, please
uncheck the "Check Buffer Status" box in the preference
pane where you selected the Lenz protocol.

This version of JMRI uses the new communications libraries introduced in 
<a href="jmri2.9.3.shtml">JMRI 2.9.3</a>.
On Windows, the installer should take care of all installation and deinstallation 
required.  On Linux, you may have to install and/or uninstall 
various communications library parts, see the
<a href="../install/Linux.html">JMRI Linux pages</a> for more info.
On Mac, depending on which version you were previously using you
may have to remove a communications library, see the
<a href="../install/MacOSX.html">JMRI Mac OS X page</a>.

<p>
You may get some messages like:
<code><pre>
WARNING:  RXTX Version mismatch
        Jar version = RXTX-2.2pre1
        native lib Version = RXTX-2.2pre2
</pre></code>
For now, this should be considered normal.  We'll try to get it
removed before the next production release.

<p>
The JInput USB library was updated to the current version in 
<a href="jmri2.9.1.shtml">JMRI 2.9.1</a>, which (should) 
have fixed problems on
Windows Vista, Intel Macs and some Linux machines.  We don't have a way to check this with all possible
input devices, so please check to make sure that your USB-attached devices still work.

<p>
When loading an older panel file containing signal head icons, you may
get WARN messages about "did not locate lunar icon file" and "did not locate flashlunar icon file".
To make these stop, just store the file again so that it's rewritten in the most recent format.

<h3>Changes since test version 2.9.4</h3>

Pete Cressman fixed a small problem with the pop-up menu on locomotive icons.

<p>
Lionel Jeanson improved how throttle images are dipslayed to take less time and memory.

<p>
Several minor problems in the throttle, effecting use with roster groups and with images, were fixed.

<p>
Lionel Jeanson updated and added several Jynstruments:
<ul>
<li>light
<li>bell
<li>horn
<li>eStop
<li>direction
<li>sound on F8 or on 2xF0 
</ul>


<p>
Dan Boudreau fixed a problem that prevented icons with blinking .gif images from blinking.

<p>
While adding Sensors, Turnouts, etc, from their tables, the program used to just fail silently
if you entered an address or system name that couldn't be used.  Now, it will pop a dialog
box to tell you that it's not creating the object and suggesting what's wrong.  
Technical note which most people can ignore: To do this,
the various managers have been modified to throw a IllegalArgumentException if they
can't process the input properly.  If you encounter this in your own code, 
you can catch it and display an error, or just get a new name and try again.

<p>
As a technical improvement, Pete Cressman improved several of the JUnit tests so they don't leave
windows lying around after then complete.

<p>
You "click" on things in the editor windows to have sensors change state, turnouts move, etc.
This code has been improved to use the proper definition of "click" for each kind of computer that
JMRI runs on.

<p>
Dan Boudreau improved how polling works when system connections get very busy.

<p>
Paul Bender fixed a crash when configuring connections over TCP/IP.

<p>
Matt Harris added a "(No Panels Available)" message to the Windows menu when there are no selections otherwise visible.

<p>
Pete Cressman added an edit menu to Memory icons in the editors.

<p>
Several problems with allocation of addresses in the JMRI throttle were fixed.

<p>
Rodolphe Braud updated the French translation with help from Dan Boudreau and Marc Fournier.

<p>
Some HP touch-panel displays don't properly general "mouse clicked" events, but only
"more pressed" and "mouse released".  To let them be used, a configuration option
has been added on the GUI preferences pane to "use non-standard mouse events".

<p>
Matt Harris set the default backup option in the Windows installer.
