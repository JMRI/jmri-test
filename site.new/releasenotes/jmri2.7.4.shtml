	<p>Subject: Test version 2.7.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the fourth in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.8 production release in December 2009. 

<p>
It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.5 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.6" available for download today. -->

<h3>Changes since test version 2.7.3</h3>

Kevin Dickerson updated the ECoS support for better turnout operation, 
and to add initial support for throttles to run locomotives through the ECoS.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson fixed a problem what would sometimes result in improperly disabled Logix and Conditionals.

<p>
Kevin Dickerson added turnout monitoring to the ECoS support.

<p>
Support for "Lunar" appearance has been added to signals.

<p>
A new "Four Output Signal Head" is available. It uses a 4th lamp (bulb or LED) to 
show a Lunar or Flashing Lunar aspect.  The Logix/Conditional support has been updated
to work with this.

<p>
Pete Cressman improved the memory spinner icon.

<p>
In preparation for new Signal Mast support, we've changed the interface to talk about
Signal Heads instead of just Signals.

<p>
Fix a problem with PowerLine initialization that would prevent certain Light configurations from working.

<p>
Pete Cressman improved the Memory spinner icon support, allowed the Light icon to be edited,
and added methods for better control of the icon editor.

<p>
Fixed a problem that prevented TwoOutput and ThreeOutput signal heads from being edited from the Signal Head Table.

<p>
Dan Boudreau added fields for RFID to the operations code.

<p>
Sakae Akanuma provided a Japanese translation.

<p>
Fixed a problem that prevented panel files from JMRI 2.7.3 from properly showing certain icons.
(More detail:  If the file specified an icon location that started with "resource:resource", 
JMRI 2.7.3 would not locate the icon)

<p>
Pete Cressman fixed a problem that prevented the format of panel editor Sensor Icon text
from being properly stored and reloaded.
