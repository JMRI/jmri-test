      Release Notes for JMRI 2.7.7 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM NN, 2009</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.7.7 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the seventh in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.8 production release in December 2009. 

<p>
It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>
<li>
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.7 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.8" available for download today. -->

<b><p>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

If you're using the "Function Label" or "Roster Image" panes with the 
DecoderPro "Comprehensive" programmer format, you should change to using
the "Advanced" format.  You select this at the bottom of the window when opening
a locomotive for editing, or via the JMRI Preferences window.

<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

Starting in JMRI 2.7.6,
the Windows installer puts the Java libraries (jar files) in a lib subdirectory.
This is the same layout used on Linux and Mac OS X, and makes the JMRI program directory
much more organized and easier to understand.  If you have your own custom startup scripts,
you may have to adjust them to the new library location.  If you're just using the JMRI 
installer and its startup tools, you shouldn't have to change anything you do.

<p>
The orientation of the coordinate system in the new audio support
changed in JMRI 2.7.6.  Starting with that
release, when you are looking at the model railroad, X is positive toward the right, Y is positive into the layout
(away from you), and Z is positive upward.  If you wrote scripts using the new audio support with
JMRI 2.7.5, you'll have to swap axes.

<p>
The new audio support in JMRI 2.7.5 requires some new libraries.
Those libraries are included in the JMRI downloads.  They, in turn, require that the
startup scripts include the new libraries, so these have also been modified.
The 2.7.4 and earlier scripts will not work with 2.7.5 and later.  In particular, if you've
created your own copies of startup scripts, you'll have to update those:

<p>
If your roster contains locomotives with Soundtraxx Steam Tsunami decoders,
you should migrate those roster entries to the new decoder definition names.
We've created a tool to make that easier.
For information on how to use that tool, please see the 
<a href="decoder2.7.5.shtml">separate note</a>.

<p>
JMRI 2.7.4 changes the way filenames for icons, etc, are stored in XML files by JMRI.
The advantage is that this new method will make it much easier to move 
panel files from one computer to another, even of a different type.  So long as you
keep all your files in the JMRI preferences directory on both machines, the files
should just move over without trouble.  The warning is that files written in this 
format will not be properly read by JMRI versions before 2.7.4.
This includes files
from earlier versions that are read by JMRI 2.7.4 or later and then written out again, 
as the program will update them to the new format upon storing them.

<h3>Changes since test version 2.7.6</h3>

The DecoderPro programmer definition files (in the xml/programmer directory) can now 
control whether the "Function Label" and "Roster Media" panes are shown.
By default, the Basic programmer and the Comprehensive don't show them.
If you want those two panes, start using the new Advanced programmer format.
"Advanced" is be the default programmer format, if you don't pick any other one.

<p>
Dan Boudreau protected the code against certain errors when reading old operations configuration files.
