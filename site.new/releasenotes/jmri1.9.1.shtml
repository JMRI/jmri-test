      Release Notes for JMRI 1.9.1 release
      </H2>

	<p>Date: MMM,DD YYYY</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 1.9.1 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

    <br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b> 

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<P>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go back to an earlier version.

<P>This is the next in a series of test versions.
It contains 
many new features, including:
<UL>
<LI>...
</UL>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.


<P>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <P>We are very pleased to announce that the 1.7 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 1.8" available for download today. -->

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<P>On using system vs user names:  System names are fixed when they are created, and refer to a specific item such as an input pin, output device, etc.  You can also attach a user name to any of these, and change it after the fact.  By convention, when you put a name in a form, we try to remember that name for the next time you reload that configuration. You can provide either a system name or a user name.  If you don't change the user name once you've set it, it doesn't matter which you provide.  But changing user names can have both good and bad effects:
<UL>
<LI>You can use them to name "functional" items, like "east entrance turnout". A particular turnout, like LT12, could be given that user name, and then "east entrance turnout" could be entered in a route or signaling definition.  Then, later, if you wanted to use a different output to control the "east entrance turnout", e.g. CT21, you could move the user name to the other turnout in the turnout table, store the configuration, and reload it (to connect up the various uses of the devices) and everything would still work.
<LI>On the other hand, if you just edit the user name for LT12 to "East Entrance TO" (note change to capitalization & abbreviation), store and load the configuration, the route will not reload properly and you'll get an error message saying that "east entrance turnout" is not defined.  
</UL>
It's up to you to decide how you want to use user names when filling out forms, and whether you might be better off using system names. 

<P>The "LocoNet Hexfile" protocol name in the preferences has always been a poor name. 
This has been changed to "LocoNet Simulator" to better reflect it's purpose.  
Some documentation may still contain the old name.

<P>For Lenz users: There are now separate choices for each of the serial-based Lenz Computer Interfaces 
(i.e. the LI100,LI100F,LI101F). Since release 1.7.3, to aid in backwards compatibility, all the interfaces 
currently have the same options as far as port speed is concerned. 
Eventually, the port speeds which are not supported by each interface WILL be removed. 
If you're using one of the interfaces listed above with this release, please check your configuration 
and select the correct device-specific option. There is no impact for LIUSB users with this change.

<P>We have added additional information to the roster files in this version to help properly handle short/long addressing 
in systems that allow low addresses (e.g. 65) to be either short or long addresses. 
The only current system we support that has this capability is NCE.
If you have an NCE system, and you have locomotives with addresses of 127 or less,
you should open their roster entries in DecoderPro, check that the proper short or long address is selected, and save them again.

<P>Indexed CVs will not be included in any printouts for this release.
 
<P>QSI CV 56.129 Engine ID Access is not supported in this release.
  
<P>While programming QSI decoders in Ops mode, it is necessary to disable CV 62 QSI Control (Verbal Acknowledgement), 
otherwise the writes will fail.
 
<P>QSI CV 64 CV Numeric Verbal Readout currently does not work for indexed CVs.
 
<P>The Route interface has had significant changes.  New member functions have been provided for configuring the Turnouts and Sensors that are changed with the Route fires.  The old methods are deprecated. If you've written your own code that uses Routes directly, you should update it.  The deprecated methods will be removed after the next production release.

<P>On Mac OS X, JMRI 1.7.3 and later uses Java 1.4 if it's available.  
This may result in some small cosmetic changes, but should resolve several bugs in the user interface. 
Also, Mac OS X is now being distributed as a disk image (DMG) file. 
To install it, double click on the file to mount it, and then drag the resulting JMRI folder to the Applications folder.

<h3>Changes since production version 1.8:</h3>

<P>Dan Boudreau contributed new "smallschematics" track icons.

<P>Several people worked to update the code to use Java 1.3; this will have some impact on interfaces in the software, if you're writing your own code that uses JMRI.

<P>Dan Boudreau updated the NCE macro editor so that it could
handle macro 0, and made other improvements.

<P>
Bob Jacobsen added tooltips to the Panel Editor to explain that the "Add" buttons are disabled until information is entered in the text boxes

<P>
Micheal Mosher added a definition for the TCS "BEMF" decoders, and updated the definition for the TCS X decoders to contain CV23, 24 and auto mars light

<P>
Dan Boudreau added tools to backup, restore and edit NCE macros.

<P>
Michael Mosher updated the QSI decoder definitions, adding many new models and features to the "Version 7" definitions.

<P>
Bob Blackwell updated the Digitrax SFX decoder definition to include a selection for CV11 on the Sound Pane. The added value is name "Sound Time Out". 

<P>
Solve a long-standing problem with SwitchIt accessory decoders on LocoNet systems by sending a "turnout off" command after each "turnout on" command. Real LocoNet throttles send "on" when you push the button and "off" when you release it.  Before this change, JMRI sent only the "message", which seemed to work fine.  However, when configured in certain ways, SwitchIt accessory decoders needed to see the "off" message to trigger.  With this change, the "off" message is sent whenever turnout is directly triggered (note "on" and "off" are complete separate from the "closed" and "thrown" directions).

<P>
Dennis Miller fixed a long-standing problem with the appearance of the startup image.
