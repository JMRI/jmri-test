	<p>Subject: Test version 2.11.5 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.
 
<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the fifth in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.12 or 3.0 production release in 2011. 

<p>
It contains 
many new features, including:

<ul>
<li>
</ul>
along with other changes.  See the complete list below.

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

(None yet)

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

Development Version 2.11.4 contains significant improvements to the Powerline Interfaces. 
Some of these improvements involved a complete restructuring of the underlying code. 
As a result, previously working Preferences may now show no connections for some of the Powerline Interfaces. 
If this occurs, go to Preferences and setup the Powerline Layout Connections again. 
Then save the Preferences and restart JMRI.

<p>
In Development Version 2.11.3 JMRI instituted a more robust and transparent system for handling missing panel icon files. 
If missing icon files are discovered during the panel loading process 
this system presents a dialog box that allows the user to either delete the offending reference 
or use the file browser to find the proper location. 
Older versions of JMRI didn't always fully remove the references to deleted panel icons. 
Panels which contain these stray references will present the dialog box during the first panel load. 
If the panel worked fine before, simply choose the delete option for each "missing" icon presented 
to remove the stray references. Once the panel has finished loading, save/store the panel file, quit JMRI and then reload. As a precaution, we recommend either making a backup copy of your panel file before diving in or saving the modified file under a different name

<p>
There have been extensive changes to the throttle code.
If you have written scripts that use throttles, particularly
multiple throttles, please check to make sure they still work.

<p>
The numerical values of "ON" and "OFF" for Lights changed in JMRI 2.11.2, 
along with some of the other constants in the class.  
This will have no impact on people just using the program.  
If you're using scripts with numerical values
in them, please recode them to use the symbolic values.

<li>Added an option to have a trottle control panel automatically switch between regular and continuous speed slider when a decoder function is activated/deactivated (most decoders have a slow function for "shunting" mode where a continuous speed slider is more appropriate for speed control).
