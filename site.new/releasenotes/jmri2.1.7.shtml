      Release Notes for JMRI 2.1.7 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2008</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.1.7 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.

<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions.

It contains 
many new features, including:
<ul>
<!-- <li>Support for the new  -->
<!--     <a href="../help/en/html/hardware/loconet/PR3.shtml">Digitrax PR3</a>. -->
<!-- <li>Support for connecting to  -->
<!--     <a href="../help/en/html/hardware/SRCP/index.shtml">SRCP servers</a>. -->
<!-- <li>Support for the X10 power adapters, -->
<!-- <li>improved consisting support, -->
<!-- <li>additional sounds and graphics for creating USS CTC panels, -->
<!-- <li>lots of additions to the help screens -->
<!-- <li>and several decoder definitions were added and improved. -->
</ul>
along with lots of other changes.  See the complete list below.


<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.

<!-- <p>We are very pleased to announce that the 2.1 series of JMRI test releases has resulted in a  -->
<!-- version that's good enough to be recommended for general use, including by new users.  -->
<!-- We're therefore making that version, "Production version 2.2" available for download today. -->

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

<h3>Warnings from older versions:</h3>

The "Double Turnout" and "Triple Turnout" signals are now called
"Double Output" and "Triple Output" in an attempt to reduce confusion of new
users.  They still work the way they used to.

<p>
Starting in the 2.1.4 version, panels should not have duplicate names.  
The program assigns a unique default name to newly created panels, and will prevent you from renaming a panel to an existing name.
If you read a file containing a panel with a name that duplicates an existing panel's name, you'll get a warning message.
Depending on user reaction, this may become a dialog box that asks if you want to continue.

<p>
The scripts used to start the JMRI applications on Linux and MacOS X have been extensively reworked.  
The new ones should do everything the old ones do, plus
<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/install/ShellScripts.shtml">more</a>.  
Please keep an eye out for new problems, however, and don't hesitate to report them to the list.

<p>
In JMRI 2.1.1, when you went to load a panel file, only files with a ".xml" filename suffix were shown by default. To see all files, you could select "All Files" in the window.  This caused some confusion because many people hadn't added the ".xml" suffix to their panel file names.  We still think having a suffix like that is valuable, but to reduce confusion in JMRI 2.1.2 when you save a panel file an ".xml" suffix is added automatically to the filename if you haven't already provided it.  This makes the filename filter work better when loading a file.  If you want to provide another suffix, or none at all, select the "All Files" option in the window before saving the file. 

<p>JMRI is moving toward requiring Java 1.4 or later.  Certain new features may not work if you are using an earlier
version of Java.  To see JMRI's future plans for this and other compatibility issues, please see the JMRI
<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/html/doc/Technical/TechRoadMap.shtml">technology roadmap</a>.

<p>JMRI no longer supports NCE AIU broadcasts. This change was needed so that JMRI could reliably read certain CV values. We recommend that if you use NCE AIUs, that you upgrade the command station EPROM to version 2007 or newer and turn off AIU broadcasts. Code has been added to detect if AIU broadcasts are enabled, and a warning message will appear at startup requesting that AIU broadcasts be turned off for proper operation of the JMRI programs.

<p>Indexed CVs will not be included in any printouts for this release.
 
<p>QSI CV 56.129 Engine ID Access is not supported in this release.
  
<p>While programming QSI decoders in Ops mode, it is necessary to disable CV 62 QSI Control (Verbal Acknowledgement), otherwise the writes will fail.
 
<p>QSI CV 64 CV Numeric Verbal Readout currently does not work for indexed CVs.

<h3>Changes since test version 2.1.5:</h3>

Dan Boudreau and Paul Bender have worked on the consisting tools.

<p>
With certain versions of Java, the analog clock would not display properly when first opened.
This is believed to be fixed.

<p>
Some changes have been made to the way RPS handles polling.

<P>
To make it easier to see and position them, 
David Duchamp added an outline to a memory icon that's being put on a layout editor panel.

<p>
More improvements in making panel files portable from one computer
to another, particularly Mac to PC and back.
Please remember to put your own custom icons in the 
<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/html/apps/PanelPro/FAQ.shtml#location">appropriate directory</a> 
so that this can work well.

<p>
More help updates, particular to the PanelPro help pages.

<p>
David Duchamp updated the getFacingSignalHead support.

<p>
Ken Cameron added a tooltip to the DecoderPro decoder selection window that
shows you the decoder ID number (CV7 value) for each type.

<p>
The 
<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/help/en/package/jmri/jmrix/rps/trackingpanel/RpsTrackingFrame.shtml">RPS tracking display</a>
has been updated.

<p>
Ken Cameron added a "RobotThrottle.py" example script to demonstrate his
automated running of trains.

<p>
Ken Cameron improved formatting in the Light control.

<p>
Andrew Crosland fixed a bug that Bob Jacobsen had accidentally introduced into the SPROG downloader screens in JMRI 2.1.5

<p>
Digitrax firmware downloader updated to handle another file format.

<p>
An internal change:  Throttle messaging has been refactored. 
If you're building your own application and now have an error with "jmrit.messager", please consult the JavaDoc.

<p>
C/MRI poll timing has been improved a little.

<p>
<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/help/en/html/hardware/can/index.shtml">Initial support</a>
for CAN-based networks is included,
focusing on the
<a href="http://www.merg.org.uk/">MERG</a>
<a href="http://www.merg.org.uk/resources/lcb.html">CBUS</a>.

<p>
Two scripts 
(<a href="../jython/ParallelPortTest.py">ParallelPortTest.py</a> and 
<a href="../jython/ParallelPortTurnouts.py">ParallelPortTurnouts.py</a>)
show how you can connect JMRI to custom hardware via a PC parallel port.
