      JMRI Install Guide: Windows
      </H2>

      <OL>
        <LI>Determine if your hardware supports Java and JMRI</LI>
      
	<P>We have had a report that a 100MHz Pentium is too slow to use, and
	another that a 120MHz Pentium II is fine, so somewhere around there is
	the minimum machine configuration, but it's important to have enough
	memory.  We recommend you have at least 48MB of memory for Windows 95
	or 98, and 64MB of memory for Windows 2000 or later.  Having 64MB or
	80MB respectively would give somewhat better performance.  For the more
	complicated programmer screens, a display with a resolution of 800x600
	or larger is strongly recommended.</P>

	<LI>Get and Install Java (if needed)</LI>

	<p> Start by making sure you have an appropriate version of Java on
	your system by typing</p>

	<p class=example> java -version </p>

	<p> You need to have Java 1.3.1 or later installed on your machine.  We
	test with JRE 1.3.1-01 and recommend you use it or a later version.  If
	you don't yet have Java installed, you can also get installers from Sun
	at <a href="http://java.sun.com/getjava/">http://java.sun.com/getjava/</a>.
	You must run the Java installer (or have previously done so) before
	running the JMRI installer in the next step, or it will issue an error
	message and stop.</p>

	<p> Sun offers both an "online" and an "offline" installer for
	the Java Runtime Engine (JRE). The online installer is about
	1.3MB, but needs an Internet connection to complete the install.
	The offine installer is about 14.5MB, but includes everything.</p>

	<p> As the size of software you can download from the Internet has
	increased, distributors have looked for ways to decrease the time
	it takes to do this. Since a software package may include features
	a user doen't need or want, one way to decrease the time is to
	make the installation "live". You initially download a small program,
	which is an Internet installer. When you run the program you are asked
	what components of the package you want to install. Only those
	components are downloaded and installed.</p>

	<p> Heres's what Sun has to say about this:
	<ul>
	<li>Windows Installation

	<p>
	Saves download time if installing only some of the features. This 
	install first downloads and runs a small program that prompts the user 
	for options to download and install. The user must be connected to the 
	Internet in order to complete this installation. Includes support for 
	additional languages, fonts and media. This choice downloads and 
	installs Microsoft Windows Installer 2.0 if not already installed. If 
	you are behind an authenticated proxy server, you must use the Windows 
	Offline Installer instead. Before making this choice, turn off any 
	download managers, other than the Sun Download Manager, if you are using it.

	<li>Windows Offline Installation
	<p>This downloaded file includes everything required to perform a complete 
	installation. It can be copied to a machine that is disconnected from 
	the network and executed to perform a complete or custom install. 
	Includes Microsoft Windows Installer 2.0 and support for additional 
	languages, fonts and media. Use this installer if the normal Windows 
	Installer does not work.
	</ul>


    <P>
    If you are using Windows 95, you may need a special version of Java.
    See
    <A HREF="http://java.com/en/download/help/win95.jsp">this page from Sun<a/>
    for more information.
    
	<LI>Get JMRI</LI>

	<p><a href="../download/index.html#prod-rel">Download</a> a version of JMRI, either the
	latest production version, or a "test version".  Since the version
	numbers change with every release, this link takes you to the general
	JMRI download page, where you can select whichever version you like.</p>

	<p>The JMRI project is continuously adding features, bug fixes,
	examples and tutorials to the release, and so a new "test" versions
	appear every couple of weeks.  You may find one of these has features
	that you really want.  These are announced in the "jmriusers" Yahoo
	discussion group at
	<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/</a>.
	</p>

	<LI>Run the JMRI installer</LI>

	<p>It will ask you to read some licensing information, and
	then install the needed libraries, plus add a "JMRI" program group to 
	your Start menu and put a shortcut to the DecoderPro program on your
	desktop.

	<LI> Installation is complete.</LI>
	<p>
	You can start the programs from the JMRI group under Programs in your
	Start menu.

	<LI>Notes:</LI>
	<H4>Windows Themes and Skins</H4>
	<p>
	If you're using a "skinning" utility which changes the appearance of
	programs running on your computer, you should tell it to ignore 
	the "java.exe" program.  That's how JMRI and DecoderPro will appear to
	it, and they weren't written with such "skins" in mind.

	<H4>Serial port configuration</H4>
	<P>DecoderPro may encounter problems if the serial port used to
	connect to the layout shares an interrupt with another serial
	port.  
	Typically COM1 and COM3 share an interrupt, as do COM2 and COM4.
	In particular, some systems are unable to communicate
	(and may experience a lockup)
	when the layout's serial port shares an interrupt with a port
	used for a serial mouse.  Please make sure that the serial port
	connected to your layout does not share an interrupt with
	another serial port.</P>
