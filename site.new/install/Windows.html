JMRI 2.5.1 and earlier Install Guide: Windows
</H1>

<OL>
    <LI>Determine if your hardware supports Java and JMRI</LI>
      
	<P>We have had a report that a 100MHz Pentium is too slow to use, and
	another that a 120MHz Pentium II is fine, so somewhere around there is
	the minimum machine configuration, but it's important to have enough
	memory.  We recommend you have at least 96MB of memory for Windows 98,
	and 128MB of memory for Windows 2000 or later.  Having 128MB or
	256MB respectively would give better performance.  For the more
	complicated programmer screens, a display with a resolution of 800x600
	or larger is strongly recommended. Note that used PC hardware is 
	available for very little money; it might be cheaper to buy a used
	computer than to update your existing one.</P>

	<LI>Get and Install Java (if needed)</LI>

	<p>You need to have Java 1.5 or later installed on your machine.  We
	test with JRE 1.6 and recommend you use it or a later version.  
	<P>If
	you don't yet have Java installed, or you have an older version,
	you can get installers from Sun
	by clicking this button:<BR>
<a href="http://java.com/java/download/index.jsp?cid=jdp74834" target="_blank">
<img width="100" height="43" border="0" style="margin: 8px;" alt="GetJava Download Button" title="GetJava" src="http://java.com/en/img/everywhere/getjava_med.gif?cid=jdp74834">
</a><br>	
	or by going to <a href="http://java.com/java/download/index.jsp">http://java.com/java/download/index.jsp</a>.
	
	<P>You must run the Java installer (or have previously done so) before
	running the JMRI installer in the next step, or it will issue an error
	message and stop.</p>

	<p> Sun offers both an "online" and an "offline" installer for
	the Java Runtime Engine (JRE). The online installer is about
	1.5MB, but needs an Internet connection to complete the install.
	The offine installer is about 20MB, but includes everything.</p>

	<p> As the size of software you can download from the Internet has
	increased, distributors have looked for ways to decrease the time
	it takes to do this. Since a software package may include features
	a user doen't need or want, one way to decrease the time is to
	make the installation "live". You initially download a small program,
	which is an Internet installer. When you run the program you are asked
	what components of the package you want to install. Only those
	components are downloaded and installed.</p>

	<p> Heres's what Sun has to say about this:
	<ul>
	<li>Windows Installation

	<p>
	Saves download time if installing only some of the features. This 
	install first downloads and runs a small program that prompts the user 
	for options to download and install. The user must be connected to the 
	Internet in order to complete this installation. Includes support for 
	additional languages, fonts and media. This choice downloads and 
	installs Microsoft Windows Installer 2.0 if not already installed. If 
	you are behind an authenticated proxy server, you must use the Windows 
	Offline Installer instead. Before making this choice, turn off any 
	download managers, other than the Sun Download Manager, if you are using it.

	<li>Windows Offline Installation
	<p>This downloaded file includes everything required to perform a complete 
	installation. It can be copied to a machine that is disconnected from 
	the network and executed to perform a complete or custom install. 
	Includes Microsoft Windows Installer 2.0 and support for additional 
	languages, fonts and media. Use this installer if the normal Windows 
	Installer does not work.
	</ul>
    
    If the "java" command doesn't work after you've installed
    Java, there might be a problem with the 
    Windows "path" variable.  This is particularly common on 
    64-bit Windows systems.  For more information, see the
    page on <a href="Win64.shtml">JMRI under Windows 64-bit</a>.
    
	<LI>Get JMRI</LI>

	<p><a href="../download/index.html#prod-rel">Download</a> a version of JMRI, either the
	latest production version, or a "test version".  Since the version
	numbers change with every release, this link takes you to the general
	JMRI download page, where you can select whichever version you like.</p>

	<p>The JMRI project is continuously adding features, bug fixes,
	examples and tutorials to the release, and so a new "test" versions
	appear every couple of weeks.  You may find one of these has features
	that you really want.  These are announced in the "jmriusers" Yahoo
	discussion group at
	<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/</a>.
	</p>

	<LI>Run the JMRI installer</LI>

	<p>It will ask you to read some licensing information, and
	then install the needed libraries, plus add a "JMRI" program group to 
	your Start menu and put a shortcut to the DecoderPro program on your
	desktop.

	<LI> Installation is complete.</LI>
	<p>
	You can start the programs from the JMRI group under Programs in your
	Start menu.

    <li>Configure the program to connect to your layout
    <p>
    The JMRI
    <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/help/en/html/hardware/index.shtml">hardware page</a>
    lists the various types of layout equipment that
    JMRI can connect to, and gives links to 
    instruction pages. Go there next to complete your
    setup.

<h2>Notes:</h2>
	
<a id="largewindow"/>
<h4>Large Windows</h4>
<img src="images/TaskbarOptions.png" height="228" width="202" align="right" alt="control panel"/>
Depending on what it wants to display, JMRI can open up very large
windows.  Generally, JMRI uses the size of the screen and 
information about fixed things like the start bar to decide the
maximum size for an opening window so that e.g. the corners can't 
be reached to resize the window.
<p>
Depending your Windows display operation, large JMRI windows
will either resize to stay on the large part of the screen, clear
of start bars and menu bars, or will be displayed at the full size of 
the screen, appearing under the start bar and menu bars.
<p>
This is controlled by the 
<a href="images/TaskbarOptions.png">Taskbar and Start Menu Properties</a>
control panel.
JMRI windows can open to the full screen size if the
'Keep the taskbar on top of other windows' option is de-selected.

Also, they can open to the full screen size if the 'Auto hide the taskbar' 
option is selected

<H4>Windows Themes and Skins</H4>
If you're using a "skinning" utility which changes the appearance of
programs running on your computer, you should tell it to ignore 
the "java.exe" program.  That's how JMRI and DecoderPro will appear to
it, and they weren't written with such "skins" in mind.

<H4>Serial port configuration</H4>
<P>DecoderPro may encounter problems if the serial port used to
connect to the layout shares an interrupt with another serial
port.  
Typically COM1 and COM3 share an interrupt, as do COM2 and COM4.
In particular, some systems are unable to communicate
(and may experience a lockup)
when the layout's serial port shares an interrupt with a port
used for a serial mouse.  Please make sure that the serial port
connected to your layout does not share an interrupt with
another serial port.</P>

<P>With Windows XP, your serial port parameters might not be properly set for 
hardware flow control. To fix this, right-click on 
My Computer and select Properties. Go to the Hardware tab and click on 
Device Manager. Open up the section that says Ports (COM &amp; LPT). 
Right-click on the serial port you have the LocoBuffer hooked to and 
select Properties. Go to the Port Settings tab and set the options 
to 19200, 8, None, 1, Hardware. Click OK. Close everything. 
Restart JMRI and verify your connection settings.</P>

<h2>Debugging</h2>
Sometimes things go wrong.  The information in this section can help.

<h4>The Log Screen</h4>

JMRI logs information about errors to a "messages.log" file in the
JMRI distribution directory, and to a console window. This window
is generally white text on a black background, and is labelled either
"Java" or "DOS".
If something is going wrong, look there for more information.
<p>
If asked for a copy of the error messages, you can usually get them
from the messages.log file.  If not, to make a copy of the 
log window:

<ol>
<li>In the command prompt window, left-click on the JMRI icon to the
left of the  words "DecoderPro" (or "PanelPro").  You will get a
drop-down menu.

<li>In that menu, put your cursor over "Edit" to get a sub-menu.  

<li>Left-click on "Select All" in that sub-menu.  All the text in the
window will reverse colors with the background, and the menus will
disappear.  

<p>
Alternately, you can left click on "Mark" in that sub-menu. The
menus will disappear.  Then, left-click and hold while dragging the
cursor over the text to be copied.  Only the selected text will
reverse colors with the background. 

<li>Repeat Steps 1 and 2 above, then left click "Copy" on the sub-menu.
 The text and window will revert to their original colors.  The text
is now on XP's clipboard.

<li>In your e-mail client, the Yahoo! "Post Message" pane, Notepad,
Wordpad, favorite word processor, etc, position your cursor and
left-click on Edit and then Paste, or press the "Ctrl" and "V" keys.
</ol>

<h4>Keeping The Log Window Open</h4>
Usually the log window closes when the program ends, and
that's what you want.  Sometimes, you want it to stay around
so you can see error messages that happen during shutdown, or even caused
the shutdown.
<p>
To get the window to stay open:
<ol>
<li>Right click and select "show properties" on the program icon
<li>Deselect "Close window on program end"
</ol>
