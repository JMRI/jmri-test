	    <H1>Installing JMRI on Ubuntu GNU/Linux</H1>

<P>These are instructions for the installation of JMRI
on a Ubuntu Linux/GNU system. Unfortunately they assume some
knowledge of Linux.  They have been used by a number of users
successfully and should work on Ubuntu, Kubuntu and Debian (The USB
port has not been tested under Debian).</P>
<P>This is still in its draft stages.</P>
<HR>
<H2>1 Introduction</H2>
<P>GNU/Linux is becoming increasingly popular as a desk
top operating system. This short instruction deals with installing
JMRI on the Ubuntu desktop.</P>
<H3>1.1 The Problem</H3>
<P>JMRI is quite easy to install on Windows. It consists
of two stages, install Java and install JMRI. Unfortunatly GNU Linux
takes five stages and involves some command line work. 
</P>
<H3>1.2 Linux/GNU</H3>
<P>GNU Linux provides a viable alternative to Windows.
As it is often free it is suitable for loading onto older machines
which may no longer have a viable legal OS.  It is also far less
resource hungry current windows distributions.</P>
<H3>1.3 Ubuntu (Debian)</H3>
<P>Ubuntu is based on Debian and is recognised as being
a very user friendly distribution. Indeed in the US Dell are going to
supply computers with it pre installed. 
</P>
<P>Details on installing Ubuntu can be found below at
Ubuntu:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.19cm"><A HREF="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download">Ubuntu
Details</A></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.29cm">Follow the Path
&quot;Download&quot; then I suggest you read up on the help page which is
offered which give one advice on how to download the iso image and
then create a bookable CD to install Ubuntu.</P>
<HR>
<H2>2 Notes</H2>
In the next section we describe how to install the components
needed before JMRI can be run, then JMRI itself.
Before starting that, make sure you're machine has a working
internet connection (for downloads), etc.

<h3>LocoBuffer USB</h3>
If you're using Ubuntu 7.10 and a
<a href="http://rr-cirkits.com/locobuffer-usb/LB-manual-USB.pdf">LocoBuffer-USB</a>
from 
<a href="http://rr-cirkits.com/">RR-Cirkits</a>
you need to download and replace a new
<a href="http://rr-cirkits.com/locobuffer-usb/linux/ftdi_sio.ko">ftdi_sio.ko file</a>
to replace the one that came with the distribution.

<HR>
<H2>3 Installation Steps</H2>
<P>There are five steps in Installing JMRI in Linux/GNU,
The are installation of Java, RxTX,JMRI itself, setting up
permissions and finally setting up the programme environment.</P>
<P><A HREF="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/install/Linux.html">The
JMRI page</A> 
</P>
<H3>3.1 JAVA</H3>
<P>One must be carefull which Java is Loaded. java
-version will often show Java 1.4.2 gij, this one is not wanted.
Blackwood does not work. 
It's best to have the "SDK" software development kit
instead of just the runtime environment (JRE).
<p>
We recommend installing from the
repositories. 
</P>
<P>System &gt; Administration &gt; Sympatic Package
Manager.</P>
<P>Then search for sun-java6-jdk (or latter version). 
Once you've found it, mark it to be loaded, and click apply.
You'll probably be told that a number of other packages will 
also be loaded. That's OK.
</P>

<H3>3.2 RxTx</H3>

<P>A problem here is that the RxTx in the Ubuntu
repositories does not work with JMRI! It appears that &quot;2.0.7pre2&quot;
is required and that is what is included in the files section.</P>
<P>Download   
<A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/files/Linux/RxTx%20Stuff/"><U>RxTx</U></A></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">and</SPAN> place
in  spare directory then unpack by double clicking, and then
extracting (extract) the file.</P>
<P><U>Then copy to the relevant sub directories.</U></P>
<P>javax.comm.properties
to /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.00/jre/lib/javax.comm.properties</P>
<P>
ext/javax.comm.rxtx.properties to
/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.00/jre/lib/ext/javax.comm.rxtx.properties</P>
<P>ext/comm.jar to
/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.00/jre/lib/ext/comm.jar</P>
<P>ext/RXTXcomm.jar to
/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.00/jre/lib/ext/RXTXcomm.jar</P>
<P>i386/* to /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.00/jre/lib/i386/
</P>
<P><U>Make a Soft link so the Programe finds the correct
RxTx</U></P>
<P>Change directory
to /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.00/jre/lib/i386/</P>
<P>And then make the link by  
</P>
<P>ln -s librxtxSerial-2.0.7pre2.so librxtxSerial.so</P>
<P>This should now have the serial port working. 
Unfortunately the programme will probably not see the USB port.  If
this is the case the start up script needs altering.  An example is
given below. (Come back to this later)</P>

<H3>3.3 JMRI</H3>
<P>JMRI is downloaded in the normal manner.</P>
<P><A HREF="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/download/index.html#prod-rel">Download
JMRI</A> 
</P>
<p>Double
click on the .tgz file to open the File Roller, then click extract. 

<P>JMRI will created inside a &quot;JMRI&quot; directory which is
created inside the directory that contains the downloaded .tgz file.  Umm..</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/JMRIdirectory.png" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=374 HEIGHT=120 BORDER=0><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>When PanelPro and DecoderPro are first run the look
for a hidden directory ".jmri" in the home directory.  
If they do not find it they create it.  To see this
hidden directory in the file browser select &quot;View&quot; and 
&quot;Show Hidden Files&quot;.
This directory holds the preferences. If you are
experiencing difficulties  with the program failing to start up, removing the
relevant Config2.xml file from this directory should fix it.</P>

<p>
You might have to set the execute bits on the scripts...
<br/>
chmod 755 *.csh

<H3>3.4 Odds And Ends</H3>
<P>Edit etc/group to change /etc/group file like this:</P>
<P>uucp:x:10 becomes uucp:x:10:your name</P>
<P>Alter Permissions on /dev/ttyS0 and 1</P>
<P>sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0</P>
<P>sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyS1</P>
<H3>3.5 The Environment</H3>
<P>On a fresh install the environment is OK, java
-version will give 
</P>
<P>java version &quot;1.6.0&quot;</P>
<P>Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0-b105)</P>
<P>Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.6.0-b105, mixed
mode, sharing)</P>
<P>If it does not this should simply be a matter of
changing the PATH variable.</P>
<P>PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.00/jre/bin/:$PATH</P>
<P>A neater way is to alter the Start Up script.  (We
need examples of start up scripts).</P>
<P>Also bash or csh. T</P>
<HR>
<H2>4 Starting JMRI</H2>
<P>To start open a terminal and enter ./DecoderPro</P>
<H3>4.1 Errors</H3>
<P>If you have any problems get make to the group.</P>
<P>No Serial Port. Have a look in System &gt;
Preferences &gt; Hardware Information. One should have a screen like
that shown showing com port as /dev/ttyS0</P>
<P>bash: ./whatever.csh: bad interpreter: No such file
or directory</P>
<P>Can not run the shell try installing csh.</P>
<P>bash; ./cats.csh: Permission denied</P>
<P>try setting the icon to executable.</P>
