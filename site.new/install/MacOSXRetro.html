      JMRI Install Guide: Mac OS X  (<b>for old releases of JMRI</b>)
      </h1>

      <p>These directions are for installing older releases of
      JMRI.</p>

      <p>If you're trying to install JMRI 2.10 or later, please see
      the <a href="MacOSX.html">production installation instructions</a>.</p>

      <p>If you're really sure you want to install an old release (I'm
      sure you have a really good reason), on to the show:</p>

      <h2>Installing old JMRI releases on to your Mac OS X computer</h2>

     <ol>
        <li>Determine if your system software is up to date</li>

	    <p>Mac OS X version 10.4 "Tiger" or later is required for
	    JMRI version 2.4 or later because those JMRI versions
	    require Java 1.5.  There's an Apple web page that lists
	    the computers that are <a
	     href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1514?viewlocale=en_US">able
	    to run Mac OS X 10.4</a> If you're still running Mac OS X
	    10.3 "Panther", you can download and use <a
	     href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/releasenotes/jmri2.2.shtml">JMRI
	    version 2.2</a>.</p>

	    <p>You should have enough memory for your computer to run
	    well, but you don't need any more than that.</p>

	    <p>The install will take up about 100MB of disk space, mostly for the help pages.
        
		<li>Determine if you have the needed hardware.
		
	    <P>No Macintosh that runs Mac OS X has built-in serial ports,
	    so if your hardware needs a serial connection, 
	    you'll have to use a USB to serial adapter.

	    <p>You will need Mac OS X drivers for the serial hardware you're using.
	    If you're using MacOS X 10.4 or later, most hardware won't need a separate driver;
	    they're already present in MacOS X.  In some cases you will need a driver, though, 
	    so check the manufacturer's web site to make sure.
	  
	    <p>
	    We test using a Keyspan PDA Adapter; those drivers are available at
	    <a href="http://www.keyspan.com/downloads/">
	    http://www.keyspan.com/downloads/</a>. Some device drivers will list
	    each port under several names, e.g. starting with "/dev/tty" or
	    "/dev/cu", for example "/dev/tty.KeyUSA19181.1". In that case, you
	    must select the one that starts with "cu", e.g.
	    "/dev/cu.KeyUSA19181.1".</p>
	      
	    <p>There's a Mac OS X driver for USB-serial adapters
	    based on the Prolific PL2303 chipset 
	    <a href="http://osx-pl2303.sourceforge.net/">available here</a>.
	    If you can't access your USB dongle and it seems to use that
	    chipset (you can check in the USB tab of System Profiler), 
	    this driver will make it available as /dev/cu.PL2303-xxx.
	     
	    <P>Note that because of baud rate limitations in Mac OS X itself,
	    it's not possible to use a Digitrax MS100 currently.
	    Use a 
	    <a href="http://rrcirkits.com/">RR-CirKits LocoBuffer-USB</a> or 
	    <a href="http://www.digitrax.com/prd_compint_pr3.php">Digitrax PR3</a> instead.
	    <P>
	    See our page on 
	    <A HREF="/help/en/html/hardware/USBtoSerial.shtml">USB adapters</a>
	    for more information
      
	<li>Install the serial communications libraries</li>

	<p>Versions of JMRI before 2.9.2 required that you install
        communications libraries on your computer.</p>
   
	<p>Although Mac OS X comes with an up-to-date Java, it doesn't
	 include the Java communications libraries.  These are needed
	 to talk to a command station, so we provide an installer.</p>
	 
	<p>If you're using Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), you first
	 have to configure Java on Mac OS X for "32 bit" operation.
	 Mac OS X 10.6 can run in either 32-bit or 64-bit mode, but
	 the communications libraries we currently use are only
	 available in 32-bit mode.  To do this, open the "Java
	 Preferences" application from the Utilities folder inside the
	 computer's Applications folder, then set the default "Java
	 Application" in the lower window to "Java SE 6 32-bit".
	 Next, download the installer for the default communications
	 library from <a
	  href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/RXTX-Leopard.pkg.zip">http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/RXTX-Leopard.pkg.zip</a>
	 (This installer also works for Intel-based Macintoshes
	 running Mac OS X 10.6, even though it's labelled for
	 Leopard). The file name will be <tt>RXTX-Leopard.pkg</tt>,
	 but the splash screen will say "Tiger" and "10.4" due to an
	 oversight; just ignore that) If the installer doesn't start
	 automatically, double click on the downloaded and expanded
	 file to install it.  You will need the Mac OS X administrator
	 password to run the installer.</p>

	 <p> If you're using Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard), download the
	 installer for the default communications library from <A
	  HREF="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/RXTX-Leopard.pkg.zip">http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/RXTX-Leopard.pkg.zip</a>
	 (This installer works for both PowerPC and Intel-based
	 Macintoshes running Mac OS X 10.5. The file name will be
	 <tt>RXTX-Leopard.pkg</tt>, but the splash screen will say
	 "Tiger" and "10.4" due to an oversight; just ignore that) If
	 the installer doesn't start automatically, double click on
	 the downloaded and expanded file to install it.  You will
	 need the Mac OS X administrator password to run the
	 installer.</p>

	 <p>f you're using Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), download the
	 installer for the default communications library from <A
	  HREF="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/RXTX-for-Intel-Mac.pkg.zip">http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/RXTX-for-Intel-Mac.pkg.zip</a>
	 (This installer works for both PowerPC and Intel-based
	 Macintoshes) Double click on the downloaded and expanded file
	 to install it.  You will need the Mac OS X administrator
	 password to run the installer.</p>

	<p>If you want to use Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) or 10.3 (Panther)
	 with a much older version of JMRI, download the necessary
	 installer for the default communications library from <A
	  HREF="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JavaCommInstaller2.hqx">http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JavaCommInstaller2.hqx</a>
	 If the installer doesn't start automatically, double click on
	 the downloaded and expanded file to install it.  You will
	 need the Mac OS X administrator password to run the
	 installer.</p>

	<p>Note that you will have to reinstall the driver and
	javax.com package if you have to reinstall the system
	software, or if you do a "clean install" of an OS update.</p>

	<li>Get JMRI</li>

	<p><a href="../download/index.html">Download</a> a version of
	JMRI.  If you're on this install page, then that version
	should be 2.8 or earlier.  As the version numbers change with
	every release, <a href="../download/index.html">this link</a>
	takes you to the general JMRI download page, where you can
	select whichever version you like.</p>

	<li>Install JMRI</li>

	<p>Normally, the download will open a new window showing a JMRI folder.
	If not, double-click the file you downloaded above.  
	This will open a window with the "JMRI" folder.</p>
	
	<p>To install, you just have to move the JMRI folder to where you
	want it on your computer. Many people put it in "Applications", which
	is the standard location for this.  To do that, just drag the JMRI
	folder onto the "Applications" icon.  If you want to keep it somewhere
	else, just drag the folder to the desired location.</p>

	<li>Installation is complete.</li>
	<p>
	You can run the program by
	double-clicking on the "DecoderPro" or "PanelPro" or
	application icons in the JMRI folder.


	<h2>Configuring your JMRI setup</h2>

	<li>Connect your computer system to your <a
	 href="../help/en/html/hardware/index.shtml">command station
	hardware</a>.</li>

	<p> Your next step will be to set the preferences for your
        particular layout connection.
    
	<p>
	MacOS X uses names like "/dev/cu.SomeName" and "/dev/tty.SomeName" for 
	devices, including USB-attached devices like USB-serial converters, LocoBuffer-USBs and similar.
	Generally, you'll want to use the one that starts with "/dev/cu" if it's present,
	but see the specific installation page for your particular type of device.  
	Sometimes you can recognize your interface from the right-hand part of the name.
	If not, the easiest way to find the name for your interface is to disconnect it, 
	start JMRI, write down the list of available devices, close JMRI, reconnect the interface, 
	start JMRI again, and look to see which extra name has appeared.
	That's the name one you want.</p>

      </ol>

<h2>Customizing Your JMRI Installation</h2>

You might want to have more than one configuration for DecoderPro
or PanelPro preset.  For example, you might to sometimes connect
PanelPro to the command station on your layout, or other times 
have a configuration that doesn't use a layout connection so you can 
work with the program on a laptop away from the layout.

<p>
With Mac OS X, JMRI makes this easy to do.  PanelPro and DecoderPro save
their preferences separately, so they can be configured independently.

<p>
On a Mac, the different preferences files take their name from the name of the application icon that's invoked.
This lets you create multiple copies of e.g. DecoderPro that each use their own, separate preferences files.
Let's say you want one called "CoolNewOne".  
<ul>
<li>Duplicate the DecoderPro application icon (ctrl-click to get a popup menu and say duplicate, 
or select the icon and choose duplicate from the File menu in Finder).
<li>Change the duplicate's name.
(It's probably better to use a simple one-word name like "CoolNewOne")
<li>Double click your new icon, and off you go.  
</ul>

It won't work to drag one of the JMRI application icons out of the 
JMRI folder, since they need the other files that can be found there.
If you want an icon in some other place, like on your desktop:

<ul>
<li>Go to the JMRI folder and select the application icon.
<li>From the file menu, select "Make Alias"
<li>Drag that new alias icon to it's new location, and optionally rename it.
</ul>

Note that renaming the alias alone does not cause the application icon to be renamed, so the alias will be using the
same preferences as the original.
