<h1>The Python/Jython language</h1>

<A HREF="http://www.python.org">Python<a/> is a widely used scripting language that's
available on many types of computers.  A Java-based varient, called
<A HREF="http://www.jython.org">Jython</a>,
has been integrated with JMRI to make it easy to control a model railroad
from the command line of a computer.  For our purposes, the two 
languages are completely the same.

<P>
If like me you prefer to read off paper, 
there are lots of books available on Python.
Perhaps one of the best for beginners is
<A HREF="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lpython2/">"Learning Python"</a>
published by O'Reilly.  It contains more than you really need to know, though.


<p>The 
<A HREF="http://www.jython.org">jython.org site</a>
has some introductory information, though their
<A HREF="http://www.python.org/doc/tut/tut.html">tutorial</A>
spends too much time on the engineering details
at the beginning.  You might want to skip to the 
<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/tut/node5.html">part about the language itself</a>.

<P>
Non-programmers might want to start with some of the resources for them 
<A HREF="http://www.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide">resources for them</a>
listed on the python website.

<p>IBM Developerworks has two good articles
<A HREF="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jython.html">here</a>
and
<A HREF="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-alj07064/">here</a>.
They also have a nice tutorial
<A HREF="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/edu/j-dw-java-jython1-i.html?S_TACT=104AHW02">here</a>, although they require you
to register with your email address to access it.
</p>

<P>
Looking at the examples in the "jython" directory in the JMRI distribution
might also help.
