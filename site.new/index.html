		<h1>What is JMRI?</h1>

		<p> The JMRI project is building tools for model railroad computer control. We
		    want it to be usable to as many people as possible, so we're building it in
		    Java to run anywhere, and we're trying to make it independent of specific
		    hardware systems.</p>
		<p> JMRI is intended as a jumping-off point for
		    hobbyists who want to control their layouts from a computer without having
		    to create an entire system from scratch.</p>
		<p> JMRI provides the 
		    <a href="./apps/DecoderPro">DecoderPro</a>
		    and 
		    <a href="./apps/PanelPro/PanelPro.html">PanelPro</a>
		    applications, tools
		    for model railroaders who want to configure DCC decoders and
		    create control panels.</p>
        <p> There's more information
            <a href="#howuse">below</a>

			The best way to learn about JMRI is often from somebody in your own 
            area.  There's a lot about it that's just easier to demonstrate than 
            to describe over email.  JMRI users (and model railroaders in 
            general) tend to be helpful, interesting people, and are often 
            amazingly helpful. But how to find somebody local?  
            <p>
            We've set up a 
            <a href="http://www.frappr.com/jmriusers">"Frappr" web site</a> that lets JMRI users mark where they're located
            so others can get in touch.
            People can add themselves to it pretty easily.  If enough people do 
            that, it'll be a useful tool when looking for somebody in your local 
            area.

            JMRI won for it's community, it's use of Java technology to empower people all over the world to contribute,
            and for the impact it's had.

            A Wiki is an online tool for gathering, organizing and presenting information.
			The best known is <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, the online encyclopedia.  JMRI
			now has a Wiki of it's own where users can add
			their own hints and tips, look up information they need, and build an
			ever-increasing set of documentation for each other.

		<h2>How can you use JMRI?</h2></a>

		There are several different ways to use JMRI:
		<ol>
		    <li>Use <a HREF="./apps/DecoderPro">DecoderPro&reg;</a> to
		    configure your locomotive decoders and keep a roster
		    of your DCC equipped locomotive fleet.

		    <li>You can use 
		    <A HREF="apps/PanelPro/PanelPro.html">PanelPro&trade;</a>
		    to run locomotives, throw
		    turnouts, control signals, and even create control panels.
		    But you shouldn't expect it to be as powerful as a
		    commercial layout management program such as WinLok or Railroad&amp;Co; 
		    JMRI isn't meant to
		    compete directly with them.

		    <li>You can use the JMRI interfaces to write programs for
		    your own layouts.  Making this easy is an important goal.
		    This can be done via our
		    <A HREF="help/en/html/tools/scripting/index.shtml">scripting language</a>,
		    or by adding new Java code to the program.
		    
		    <li>You can write new general-purpose tools.  Although this
		    is a little harder than writing automation for your own
		    layout, writing tools that other people use can be very
		    satisfying.

		    <li>You can implement the JMRI interfaces for a new system.
		    Having JMRI work with other systems is an important goal.
		    Once an implementation for another system works, the
		    general tools (e.g.  symbolic programmer, automations
		    tools, signaling, etc) can be immediately used.
		    </ol>
		    
		<a id="moreinfo">
		<h2>More Info on the JMRI project</h2></a>
		<p>JMRI is intended as a
		jumping-off point for hobbyists who want to control their
		layouts from a computer without having to create an entire
		system from scratch.</p>

		<p> To do this, we've split the problem into two parts with an
		interface in-between:
		<ul>
		<li>"Above" the interface are the cool tools that people want.
		     We provide programmers for DCC decoders, 
		     layout controls, automation tools, etc.  
		     People are continuously contributing better
		     and better tools that still will work on lots of type of
		     computers, with lots of types of layouts.
		<li>"Below" the interface lies code that connects to specific
		     layout hardware.  We connected to a
		     <a href="hardware">full range of systems</a>:
		     C/MRI, Digitrax, EasyDCC, Lenz, NCE, etc.
		     We are certainly
		     interested in connecting to other systems.
		</ul></p>

		<p> The long-term strategy is to:
		<ul>
		<li>Create a set of publically available common interfaces for
		    model railroad control code, suitable for use with any type
		    of layout, from any type of computer.
		<li>Make these useful by providing quality implementations
		    for as many types of layouts as possible.
		<li>Encourage interoperability of layout hardware and software
		    through the use of common interfaces.
		</ul></p>

		<p> In the short term, we've created several programs based on
		the JMRI libraries to move the project along and demonstrate
		its capabilities.
		(<a href="./releasenotes/history.html">Why so many programs?...</a>)
		</p>

		<p> The most popular is
			<a href="apps/DecoderPro">DecoderPro</a>,
		a better tool for programming decoders.  It simplifies the job
		of configuring complicated DCC decoders by providing screens on
		which you can select the various options and values you want.
		These screens show the exact contents of each specific decoder
		type. Both the programming screens and decoder information are
		stored in text files, so you can make up new ones as
		desired.</p>
