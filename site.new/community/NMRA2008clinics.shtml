For those planning to attend the

July 13th thru July 19th, 2008, 
six clinics and our annual user meeting have been  
scheduled.  Two of the six clinics will be repeated.
<p>
For planning purposes, please note that Sunday night 7PM-11PM and  
Monday night 7PM-11PM and Wednesday night 10PM - 11PM are the main  
JMRI clinic times. Starting Sunday night is earlier in the meeting  
than usual, but these are the best times we could get.

Our JMRI User Group Meeting will be Wednesday night.
The two introductory clinics will be presented
on Sunday and repeated on Friday.
