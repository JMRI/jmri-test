For those planning to attend the 
<a href="http://www.nmra.org">NMRA</a>
<a href="http://www.nmra.org/2008/">Anaheim National Convention</a>, 
July 13th thru July 19th, 2008, 
six clinics and our annual user meeting have been  
scheduled.  Two of the six clinics will be repeated.
<p>
For planning purposes, please note that Sunday night 7PM-11PM and  
Monday night 7PM-11PM and Wednesday night 10PM - 11PM are the main  
JMRI clinic times. Starting Sunday night is earlier in the meeting  
than usual, but these are the best times we could get. 

<p>
Our JMRI User Group Meeting will be Wednesday night.
The two introductory clinics will be presented
on Sunday and repeated on Friday.
