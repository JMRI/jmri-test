    <h2>JMRI Defense: Our Story So Far</h2>
 
 <!-- the content goes here -->
 
This page describes our efforts to protect our Open Source project from 
attacks by a patent holder.  
He makes arguments in federal court to justify his actions, 
and if he prevails, 
he will strike right at the heart of the Open Source community.  
We are one of the first projects to have to defend against bogus 
patent claims and protect its copyrighted software and license.  
We certainly won't be the last. 
Here's our story. 
 
<h4><A ID="intro"/>Introduction</h4>
<A HREF="/index.html">JMRI</a>
is open-source software for model-railroaders.  There's a
<a href="/index.html">separate page</a>
that describes the history of the project, and gives further links.
"<a href="/apps/DecoderPro/index.html">DecoderPro&reg;</a>" 
and 
"<a href="/apps/PanelPro/PanelPro.html">PanelPro&trade;</a>"
are built on JMRI, and are popular tools for programming locomotives
and operating layouts.
DecoderPro has been around for several years.
<P>
Matt Katzer owns 
<a HREF="http://kamind.com">KAM Industries</a>, 
a company that tries to sell
model railroad software.  He's never 
<a href="../community/index.html">contributed</a>
anything to the JMRI effort.
But that hasn't stopped him from taking JMRI intellectual 
property.

<P>
Matt Katzer and his company
<A HREF="http://kamind.net/">KAMIND Associates, Inc. <A/>
are attacking the 
rights of open source groups to enforce their copyrights and licenses.  
If they prevail, the rights of open source groups like JMRI will 
be significantly weakened, if not lost.  We are breaking ground for 
open source groups in federal court and establishing legal rights for 
open source groups and their members.  
We need your help and donations to help us with this legal fight.
<P>
In the next sections we discuss Katzer's cybersquatting, 
enforcement of bogus patents, 
copyright infringement and 
our fight in federal court.

<h4>Cybersquatting and the decoderpro.com domain name</h4>
In October of 2004, 
we noticed that Katzer had registered
decoderpro.com as a domain name in February of 2004.  
When asked about it, 
Katzer said he was considering whether he would
<q>
be able to take the open source
code  and turn it into a licensed product so it could be distributed
</q>.
Katzer also said he had the name because
<blockquote>
If I decide that to released (sic) a licensed version of an open source
development effort, what better place to have it then the name of the
development effort?
</blockquote>
<P>
We registered the DecoderPro&reg; name as a federal trademark.  
This was expensive, so we sought 
<A href="donations.html">donations</a> 
through our JMRI web site on SourceForge.
Bob Jacobsen, one of the JMRI developers and the person
who maintains the JMRI web site,
<A href="correspondence/20041108-RGJ.pdf">wrote to Matt Katzer</a> asking for the return of
the domain name, but never received a reply.
Jerry Britton, a JMRI user, offered to trade another domain name for it. 
Instead, 
<A HREF="Britton/3-04-cv-01627-JE-doc-1.pdf">Matt Katzer sued him</a>.
That suit was eventually 
<A HREF="Britton/3-04-cv-01627-JE-doc-4.pdf">settled</a>
by having them swap
domains, so that Jerry ended up with decoderpro.com
-- and a lot of restrictions that Katzer imposed on him. 
For one, Jerry can't transfer decoderpro.com to anyone else, 
including JMRI. 
If he did, Jerry would have to pay $20,000 plus attorney's fees.
(Note that Katzer did not impose similar transfer restrictions on 
himself for the domain name he got out of the deal.)
Katzer also demanded
that Jerry not talk about this agreement, on pain of 
a $20,000 penalty.
We learned of this settlement from public records in
the Oregon federal court, because Katzer's attorney 
Kevin Russell didn't file the agreement under seal as he was supposed to.

<h4>Bogus Patents</h4>

Beginning in 1998, Katzer applied for multiple
patents on technology developed by other people.
The US Patent Office granted
them, in part because Katzer failed to tell the patent 
examiner what he knew about existing products
and inventors. 

<P>
Katzer filed his 
<A HREF="http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6065406.PN.&OS=PN/6065406&RS=PN/6065406">first patent application</a>
on June 24, 1998. 
Although well aware of other's work,
Katzer intentionally did not tell the Patent Office that
the "invention" he was claiming had already been 
done by, among others,
<UL>
<LI>Juergen Freiwald's TrainController (Railroad&Co)
<LI>John Kabat's LocoNet VxD
<LI>Hans-Rudi Tanner's WinLok (although he did mention DigiToys, Hans-Rudi's company, 
Katzer didn't tell the examiner the name of WinLok or produce it 
for the examiner)
<LI>Strad Bushby's model railroad, using Digitrax LocoNet to connect multiple
computers
</UL>
and others.
There's no doubt that Katzer knew of these.
Katzer described them in his talk at the
<A HREF="docket/46-47.pdf">1997</a> NMRA convention, and in his
<A HREF="docket/46-33.pdf">1st</a>,
<A HREF="docket/46-37.pdf">2nd</a> and
<A HREF="docket/46-38.pdf">3rd</a>
talks at the 1998 convention.
If he had produced this information to the patent examiner, 
as he was required to do by law, 
these patents would never have been
granted, and everybody would have been saved a lot of trouble.

<P>
After the first patents were granted, Katzer filed a
<A HREF="docket/46-31.pdf">lawsuit</a>
against Hans-Rudi Tanner and another 
<A HREF="docket/46-34.pdf">suit</a>
against Juergen Freiwald for patent
infringement, and sent 
<A HREF="docket/47-5.pdf">cease and desist letters</a>
to many of their of dealers. 
Juergen and Hans-Rudi both 
<A HREF="docket/47-6.pdf">wrote</a> 
Katzer in October 2002, 
explaining that
lots of "prior art" existed to demonstrate that Katzer's
patent was invalid, and that since Katzer knew about those
pre-existing programs, he'd violated 
his duty to tell the patent examiner the information
when he filed
his patent application.
Shortly thereafter, Katzer 
<A HREF="docket/46-32.pdf">dropped</a>
the suits.

<P>
Katzer didn't shy away from using his patents to push hobbyists around.
On September 8, 2004, Glenn Butcher wrote to the
loconet_info mailing list:
<blockquote>
Mr Kratzer(sic) and I have had a short exchange of emails on the topic of his 
patents.  As a result, I have chosen to remove my loconetd and railroadd 
servers and client apps from my website.   Mr Kratzer(sic) forwarded a FAQ on 
his technology licensing that contained a list of questions to aid in 
determining whether others' efforts could be infringing on his patents; 
some are specific but in my opinion others appear to be general enough 
to cover most of the software development activity discussed on this 
list.  As I don't have the resources to consult a patent attorney in 
this matter, I've taken a conservative approach to protecting myself.
<br>
I find it disappointing to have to do this, especially to protect the 
rights to exclusively use what, in my opinion, appear to be simple 
extensions of what I used to teach in undergraduate computer science.  
However, I don't think it's worth fighting when that time could be spent 
building my layout, money could be spent on the brass D&RGW K-37 I so 
dearly covet...
</blockquote>

<P>
This also resulted in a large amount of criticism of Katzer's
actions, with a number of people announcing that they would no longer 
consider his products.
(As we 
<A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/message/17824">have stated before</a>, 
we are dead set against any 
harassment or boycotting actions, 
and believe that model railroaders should be able to buy whatever products they want.)

<P>
Meanwhile, in March and April 2002, JMRI developers were working
on "client/server" capabilities for LocoNet.  
Client/server communications for model or 
prototype railroads are not novel; there are 
lots of examples available, dating back for 
years. 
The client/server capability
was a straightforward implementation using Sun Microsystem's
Java RMI software tools (the similarity to the JMRI acronym is coincidental, 
though confusing). 
Using these,
a remote computer running a JMRI product (e.g. DecoderPro, PanelPro, etc)
could operate the layout by connecting to a local server computer
that was directly connected to the layout.  
We discussed this update in March 2002 on a public email list while 
it was being developed.  
On April 14, 2002,
we announced the client/server update as part of a JMRI test release. 
As always, the source code was available 
to the public on the web.
<P>
Three days later, on April 17, 2002, Katzer
fired off a 
<A HREF="http://portal.uspto.gov/external/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_CH/.cmd/ad/.ar/sa.getBib/.ps/N/.c/6_0_69/.ce/7_0_3AB/.p/5_0_341/.d/8?selectedTab=continuitytab&isSubmitted=isSubmitted&dosnum=10124878#7_0_3AB">patent application</a>
intended to cover this, and claimed a filing
date of June 1998.
He could do this --
US patent law allows for "continuation applications".
If you have a pending application, you can file another one
that "gains the benefit" of the earlier application.  From a legal
perspective, Katzer could make his applications look as if
he'd invented the JMRI capability in 1998!

<P>
By misleading
the Patent Office, 
Katzer was able to obtain a patent on this capability
by the start of 2003.  
Specifically, he has a patent on any system that
<blockquote>
1. A method of operating a digitally controlled model railroad comprising the steps of: 
<BR>
(a) transmitting a first command from a first program to an interface; 
<BR>
(b) transmitting a second command from a second program to said interface; and 
<BR>
(c) sending third and fourth commands from said interface representative of said first and second commands, respectively, to a digital command station. 
</blockquote>
<br/>
(Claim 1 of US patent 
<A HREF="http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6530329-fulltext.html">6,530,329</a>,
aka "the '329 patent")


<h4>Enforcing Patents Against JMRI and Bob Jacobsen</h4>

After the '329 patent issued, 
Katzer and Russell sent letters
that 
<A HREF="correspondence/20050308-KAM.pdf">demanded $19</a>, 
and later 
<A HREF="correspondence/20050824-KAM.pdf">$29 in royalties</a>
per downloaded copy of JMRI.
We believe that the patent was invalid because of prior art, 
and if they had provided the prior art in their possession to the
patent examiner in the first place, the patent would never have been granted.
It didn't stop them.  
Bob Jacobsen received 
<A HREF="correspondence/20050824-KAM-A.pdf">bills for in excess of $200,000</a> 
on a roughly monthly basis from August 2005 to January 2006.
(There's a separate 
<A HREF="correspondence/index.html">correspondence page</a>
that has the all the letters)
<P>
When that harassment 
wasn't enough to stop JMRI, 
Katzer and Russell 
contacted Bob's employer 
in an attempt to intimidate him.  
Bob is a physics professor who works part time
for the University of California at Berkeley, and
part time at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL, 
run by the US Department of Energy). 
<A HREF="http://www.lbl.gov">LBL<a/>
is run by a Nobel-prize-winning
physicist, and has thousands of scientists doing basic and applied forefront 
research.
Russell sent a 
<A HREF="correspondence/FOIA-20051027.pdf">Freedom of Information Act request</a>
to LBL, asserting that the Laboratory
"had duties for the JMRI project", and that 
KAM's patents were "being infringed by the JMRI project sponsored
by the LAB". The request went on to ask for Bob's private emails, along with
a number of other types of information designed to embarrass Bob
in front of his employer.
<P>
The Department of Energy eventually decided that the request was 
<A HREF="misc/FOIA1.pdf">without merit</a>, 
but only after it had caused a lot of trouble.

<P>
In the meantime, 
<A HREF="correspondence/20060105-KAM-1.pdf">Russell continued to send</a>
fraudulent
<A HREF="correspondence/20060105-KAM-3.pdf">invoices for more than $200,000</a>.

<A ID="2006-03-13">
<h4>Jacobsen asks for a Declaratory Judgment</h4>

In March 2006, we couldn't allow this to go on, and filed a 
<A HREF="docket/1.pdf">"Declaratory Judgment"</A> 
action
in Federal Court to get a legal determination
on our rights.
<P>
The complaint lists acts of unfair competition, 
libel, patent fraud and misrepresentation, etc, and
asks that the Court issue injunctions to prevent
Russell and Katzer from continuing them.

<A ID="2006-07-12">
<h4>Anti-SLAPP motions</h4>

In mid-May 2006, Katzer and Russell filed several motions
to dismiss parts of the complaint. In particular, 
Katzer filed a motion to 
<A HREF="docket/29.pdf">dismiss the libel claims</a> 
under the California anti-SLAPP law, and Russell
filed motions to 
dismiss claims 
<A HREF="docket/23.pdf">under the anti-SLAPP law</a>
and 
<A HREF="docket/18.pdf">for the procedural reasons</a>
of lack of personal jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.

<P>
The California anti-SLAPP law is intended to protect people 
who make comments about 
issues of public interest, or as part of official government proceedings.
It was not originally intended to protect corporate wrong-doers, though 
it's being used that way more and more. It's particularly dangerous for JMRI,
because it automatically requires that, if a suit is struck down due to the
anti-SLAPP law, the defendants (in this case Matt Katzer, KAM and/or Kevin Russell) get
their legal costs reimbursed by the plaintiff (Bob Jacobsen).

<P>
In their 
<a href="docket/index.html#k-anti-slapp">motions and associated declarations</a>,
they make some pretty unbelievable claims.  For example, Katzer in his 
<a href="docket/13.pdf">declaration</a>
refers to the Department of Energy's "apparent sponsorship of the java
model railroad interface (sic) (JMRI) project".  
He then argues
that his "reasonable" belief was based on:
<UL>
<LI>Two papers (which he misrepresents) where 
the National Science Foundation (not the Department of Energy or LBL)
has provided money for a college to use model trains in teaching real-time programming
and communications.

<LI>"Notice of the formation of JMRI on DOE or other official 
letterhead" that he said he "believed" he saw on the JMRIusers discussion 
group in January or February 2004. 
Setting aside that JMRI had existed for years before the date he 
here claimed it was "formed", 
both Yahoo and Internet Archive show no indication of such "notice" ever existed.
The statement is a complete fabrication.

<LI>Bob Jacobsen's emails and posting which Katzer misrepresented
as "documents promoting JMRI",
"including a request for funding".

</UL>
Katzer then claims that:
<blockquote>
"It was not the purpose of the FOIA request to embarrass Jacobsen with his employer,
as alleged in the complaint. At the time of sending the FOIA request, I had no
knowledge of Jacobsen's employment status, either with the DOE or any other 
employer. At the time of sending the FOIA request, I assumed that Jacobsen 
worked for the University of California at Berkeley based on a representation
Jacobsen made to a model train internet newsgroup in 2001."
</blockquote>
Note that the third sentence contradicts the second in that paragraph.
It's simply unbelievable that Katzer didn't think
Bob worked for LBL, given that Katzer was already aware of Bob's use of an
LBL email address.  They had even had several direct email exchanges in the past.

<P>
Still, given the structure of the California anti-SLAPP law
and that Katzer is willing to lie to the court, 
it's going to take a very large amount of effort to defeat these motions.
We'll be submitting replies, which will be available from 
the 
<A href="docket/index.html#k-anti-slapp">documents page</a>
once they're in.

<A ID="2006-08-13">
<h4>Court Hearing</h4>
On August 11, 2006, the Court held a hearing to decide
the motions.
The day before, the Court had issued a 
<A HREF="docket/85.pdf">tentative ruling<a/>
that indicated the questions that were to be addressed in the 
hearing, and said that the Court was tentatively planning
to grant all the motions (basically giving Katzer, KAM
and Russell all that they had requested).

<P>
The hearing lasted about 90 minutes, during which the 
Judge asked thoughtful questions of both sides.  Clearly, he
was trying to understand the issues raised in the large
legal briefs.  In the end, however, he
adopted the tentative order, and 
issued a 
<A HREF="docket/86.pdf">"minute order"</a>
to that effect.  

<P>
We don't have the Court's reasoning yet, but we believe that - 
because of California's anti-SLAPP procedure - 
the Court will state that it could not hear evidence that would 
contradict Katzer's false statements. 
As a result, Katzer prevailed.   
And as a result, California's anti-SLAPP law requires that the
defendants (Katzer and Russell) be reimbursed for their legal fees.  
The next step is the Court ruling on 
Katzer and Russell's 
<A HREF="docket/index.html#fees1">attorneys fee requests</a>.
We have filed objections with the Court, and 
demand more detail of the bills than the sketchy 
outlines that have been provided so far. 
But if the requests are found to be reasonable, the Court will then order them paid. 

<P>
The important thing is that the main parts of the case are still 
intact.  However, certain claims in
the original complaint have been removed. The 
Court will no longer consider libel or anti-trust 
charges against Katzer, nor any charges against 
Russell.


<A ID="2006-09-10">
<h4>Infringing Copyrighted Material</h4>

Katzer took JMRI copyrighted code, 
stripped out authors' names and JMRI copyright notices, 
converted it to his own use and then distributed it as his own.

<P>
DecoderPro is able to easily configure more than 300
types of devices because hobbyists have contributed more
than 100 
<A HREF="../apps/DecoderPro/CreateDecoder.html">decoder definition files</a>.  
These definitions, produced by lots of separate
<a href="../community/index.html">contributors</a>,
are what makes the program so useful, 
since they express a model railroader's view of how best to configure
a particular device.  DecoderPro first started using this approach
in September of 2001.
<P>
In 2004, Matt Katzer started talking about "his" Decoder Commander
product.  It was finally released in 2005; on his web site, 
Katzer used to claim:
<blockquote>
In June 2005 at the [NMRA] Cincinnati convention we Introduced Decoder Commander. 
The first XML based distributed programmer.(sic)
</blockquote>
(Untrue, as JMRI predated this by years)
Imagine our surprise when we discovered
that he had copied the JMRI decoder definitions
for distribution on his CDs, and had provided no credit to 
JMRI!  In fact, he tried to claim ownership, saying
in the product manual
<blockquote>
All decoders have unique characteristics. 
KAM has created a set of Decoder Templates 
that has these characteristics in an XML configuration file.
</blockquote>
A 
<a href="copycomparison.html">separate page</a>
discusses some of the evidence for the copying in detail, but we can 
summarize some key points:
<UL>
<LI>He distributed a copy of each of the JMRI files.
For example, the content of the JMRI QSI_Electric.xml 
file was included on
the Decoder Commander CD in a file called QSI_Electric.tpl.xml; the names
are identical except for adding the ".tpl" modifier. 
All of the files on the KAM version 304 CD were based on JMRI files
in this way; no extra
files were present on the KAM version 304 CD.
<LI>Original JMRI definition files contain the version, the date modified, 
the author's name, and a copyright notice.  
These have
free-form content, so there are many formats.  The version
strings and the modification date strings in the KAM files are
EXACTLY the same as those in the original JMRI files they were
copied from.  The author's name, however, was not copied into
the KAM file, nor was the JMRI copyright information.
<LI>Many details of the content of the original JMRI files were
copied exactly:  Misspellings, odd capitalizations, technical errors, 
even the order in which options are described were all copied over
exactly.
</UL>
KAM created a tool that copies JMRI definitions and 
stores them in the KAM format, 
deliberately omitting all evidence of
their origin with DecoderPro. 
Katzer even advertises this
tool as a feature of "his" product, without crediting or even mentioning 
JMRI.

<A ID="2006-09-11">
<h4>Amended Complaint</h4>

On September 11, 2006, we filed an
"<A HREF="docket/96.pdf">Amended Complaint</a>"
with the Court.  
This includes descriptions of Katzer's and KAM's copyright
and trademark violations (discussed 
<a href="#2006-09-10">above</a>) 
and asks the Court for relief.

<h4>Another Round of Motions from Katzer</h4>
September 27, 2006: 
Katzer's lawyer has filed another 
<A HREF="docket/100.pdf">motion to dismiss</a> 
parts of the amended complaint.
<P>
In it, he doesn't argue that Katzer didn't copy the JMRI software
in violation of the copyright terms, probably because even HE can't stretch
the truth that far. Instead, he argues that copyright doesn't protect
free and open source (FOSS) software!  You can read the entire argument
in the 
<A HREF="docket/100.pdf">motion filed with the court</a>,
in particular the section named
"Plaintiff has waived his ability to sue under the Copyright Act"
starting on page 13.
Basically, it says that since JMRI makes the software available on the web, 
free of charge (although not free of restriction), 
when someone like Katzer takes it and uses it in violation of 
those restrictions, we can sue him in contract law only, if at all.
The shocking part of Katzer's argument is that he says we have no rights under 
either copyright or contract to enforce.
<P>
This argument strikes right at the heart of much of FOSS licensing.  
It's already hard enough for the FOSS community to enforce its legal rights.
If we lose the possibility of protecting the integrity of our work via copyrights,
we'll be in a terrible situation.
We hope you'll help us in this fight.

<h4>Written Ruling on Initial Motions</h4>

On October 20th, 2006, the Court issued its
<A HREF="docket/111.pdf">written order</a>
on the initial motions.  
The decision was along the lines of the 
<A HREF="docket/86.pdf">minute order</a>
issued right after the hearing
and 
<A HREF="#2006-08-13">discussed previously</a>.
The Court did find that the full amount of the legal 
fees demanded by Jerger and Zeff was "excessive" and "unreasonable", 
so it reduced the amounts
to $14,486.68 and $16,976.25 respectively.

<h4>Request for Preliminary Injunction Against Copyright Infringement</h4>
October 25, 2006:
Given the strength of the evidence that Katzer copied from
JMRI, and given that it appears that he's going to continue,
we asked the court for a preliminary injunction. The
<A HREF="docket/114.pdf">motion</a>
was accompanied by 
<A HREF="docket/index.html#114">two declarations and several exhibits</a>.
This has been scheduled for a hearing on December 22, 2006.

<A ID="2006-10-30"/>
<h4>Request for Reconsideration of Motions Denied</h4>
On October 30, 2006, we filed a 
"<A HREF="docket/120.pdf">Motion for Leave to File</a> Motion for Reconsideration, Motion for Stay, and Request for Clarification".
This is a preliminary step required before seeking reconsideration of the 
written order of October 20th, 2006.
It lays out the reasons why we think that reconsideration is justified.
The Court 
<A HREF="docket/121.pdf">denied the request</a>
that same day. 
As a result, 
Bob paid the 
<A HREF="#2006-10-20">legal fees demanded</a> by Jerger and Zeff.
David Zeff wasn't content
to actually wait for the deadline, however, and sent another
<a href="docket/122.pdf">threatening email</a> (see page 15 in the linked filing).

<h4>Reply to Motions; Defending Open-Source Copyright</h4>
On November 3, 2006, we filed an
<A HREF="docket/123.pdf">opposition</a>
(basically, a rebuttal argument)
to Katzer's
<A HREF="#2006-10-03">motion of September 28th</a>
in which he argues that copyright law shouldn't apply to his
theft of the JMRI files.
There are various technical elements involved, but the
most important parts are the sections defending
the use of copyright for protecting open-source software (pages 3 through 10).
The next steps are a reply from Katzer, due on November 17th, 
then a decision from the Court. We will probably have a tentative
ruling the day before the hearing (currently scheduled for December 15th), followed 
by the final ruling.

<h4>Next Hearings</h4>
There are currently two hearings scheduled:
<UL>
<LI>December 15, 2006 - On Katzer's 
<A HREF="docket/index.html#motions2">motions</a> re the
Amended Complaint
to dismiss for failure 
to state a claim on which relief can be granted, 
motion to dismiss for failure to join a necessary 
party, motion to strike, and motion for a more definite statement.
This is the hearing that will decide on the validity of Katzer's
claim that copyright law does not apply to his actions.
<LI>December 22, 2006 - On Bob Jacobsen's 
<A HREF="docket/index.html#preliminjunction1">motion for preliminary injunction</a>
to prevent further copyright violations
</UL>

<P>
For those of you in the San Francisco area, it would be great 
if you could come out and attend a hearing to <u>respectfully</u> 
support open-source software. 
The hearings will be held at 9AM in 
Judge Jeffrey S. White's courtroom,
Courtroom 2 on the 17th floor of the Federal Court Building, 
450 Golden Gate Ave., San Francisco.
