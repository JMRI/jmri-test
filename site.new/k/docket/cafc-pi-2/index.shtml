    <h2>JMRI Defense: Papers from Second Appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</h2>
 
 <!-- the content goes here -->
 
Most of our legal defense is happening in the
Northern District of Calfornia federal court.
Papers from there are available on our
<A HREF="../index.shtml">main docket page</a>.

On this page, we're providing copies of the court papers from
our second appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, located in
Washington DC.
This is taking place during 2009.  
If you're interested
in papers from the first appeal, during 2008, they're on a 
<a href="../cafc-pi-1/index.shtml">separate page</a>.
