<h3>Cybersquatting and the decoderpro.com domain name</h3>

In October 2004, we learned that Matt Katzer
had registered decoderpro.com as a domain name in
February 2004. Katzer had never had any role in developing DecoderPro.  
When asked about the domain name registration, Katzer
said he was considering whether he would
<blockquote>
"be able to take the open source
code  and turn it into a licensed product so it could be distributed"
</blockquote>
Katzer also said he had the name because
<blockquote>
"If I decide that to released (sic) a licensed version of an open source
development effort, what better place to have it then the name of the
development effort?"
</blockquote>

<P>
Bob Jacobsen, one of the JMRI
developers and the person who maintains the JMRI
web site, 
<A HREF="../correspondence/20041108-RGJ.pdf">wrote to Matt Katzer</a>
demanding the domain name. 
Katzer never replied. 
Jerry Britton, a JMRI user, offered to
trade another domain name for it. 
Instead, 
<A HREF="../Britton/3-04-cv-01627-JE-doc-1.pdf">Matt Katzer sued him</a>.
That suit was eventually 
<A HREF="../Britton/3-04-cv-01627-JE-doc-4.pdf">settled</a>
by having them swap
domains, so that Jerry ended up with decoderpro.com
-- and a lot of restrictions that Katzer imposed on him. 
For one, Jerry couldn't transfer decoderpro.com
to anyone else, including JMRI. If he did, Jerry
would have to pay $20,000 plus attorney's fees.
(Of course, Katzer's attorney Kevin Russell, who 
drafted the settlement agreement, did not impose similar transfer
restrictions on Katzer for the domain name Katzer
got out of the deal.) Katzer also demanded that
Jerry not talk about this agreement, on pain of a
$20,000 penalty. We learned of this settlement
from public records in the Oregon federal court,
because Katzer's attorney didn't
file the agreement under seal as he was supposed
to.

<h3>Getting Decoderpro.com Transferred</h3>

DecoderPro is a JMRI trademark, and we wanted that domain name.
As part of our efforts to defend JMRI from Katzer's infringements, 
we asked the Court to order the domain name transferred
as a part of a cybersquatting claim.

<P>
Matt Katzer filed a
<A HREF="../docket/100.pdf">motion</a>
asking that the whole cybersquatting claim be dismissed 
because we'd not
"joined all necessary parties" -- that is, we had
not named the the current holder of the domain
name, Jerry Britton, who lives on the other side
of the country. There is a legal rule that a case
has to include all people whose interest might be
seriously harmed, so that they can have a say in
the case. Katzer was trying to use it to force us
to either drag in Jerry Britton, another model
railroader who just wants Katzer to leave him
alone, or drop our request to get our domain name
back.

<P>
We argued against having to include
Jerry, both in our written
<A HREF="../docket/123.pdf">response to the motion</a> (see page 14)
and during the 
<A HREF="../updates.html#2007-01-19">January 19th hearing</a>,
but it was not clear how the Judge would rule.

<h3>The UDRP Complaint and Decision</h3>

The Internet community has a process, 
the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP),
for determining who has the right to a domain name.  
The process is 
<A HREF="http://www.icann.org/udrp/#udrp">well documented</a>,
and requires those who want a domain name transferred to 
themselves to prove they are entitled to it, 
the current registrant is not entitled to the domain name, 
and that the current registrant registered and 
used the domain name in bad faith.
<P>
The UDRP process starts with a formal complaint,
which is a legal document requiring significant
preparation. The domain name holder is then
allowed to respond, and both sets of documents
are sent to an independent panel. There are a
number of procedural steps that have to be
followed to ensure that the decision is made
fairly and independently. All of this is
expensive, typically costing $1500 or more for
the panel alone.

<P>
On May 23, 2007, we filed a UDRP complaint with
the World Intellectual Property Organization
(WIPO) in Switzerland.

<P>
The WIPO panel promptly returned a 
<A HREF="http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2007/d2007-0763.html">decision</a>.
Because of the transfer from Katzer to Jerry Britton,
also known as "cyberflight", 
we argued that Katzer's bad faith actions should be considered.  
The panel agreed and had an entire section on 
"Katzer's Bad Faith", including:

<UL>
<LI>"Indeed, the evidence supports the conclusion that 
Katzer had no purpose in registering the name except to 
keep it out of others' hands, including Complainant's hands."

<LI>"it is difficult to conceive of a legitimate use Katzer could make of the Domain Name."

<LI>"In the Panel's view, there is essentially a purpose on the 
part of Katzer to disrupt the business of a competitor by 
interfering with Complainant's exercise of his trademark rights."
</UL>
<P>
and ended with the statement that:
<UL>
<LI>"The Panel concludes that Complainant has demonstrated sufficient evidence of bad faith registration and use of the Domain Name on the part of Katzer"
</UL>
<P>
The WIPO Panel then ordered the decoderpro.com
domain name transferred. We expect it to be
transferred shortly.

<P>
It's undeniable that this is a win for JMRI. An impartial
panel, experienced in Internet and trademark law,
has made a clear statement that Katzer had acted
in "bad faith". Although that's been clear to us
in the community since the beginning, having an
impartial panel ruling in our favor is a big step
toward holding Katzer accountable for his actions.

<P>
We have 
<A HREF="../docket/156.pdf">informed the Court of this result</a>,
and pointed out that it makes Katzer's objection
moot because we will no longer ask the Court to
order transfer of the decoderpro.com domain name.
That removes any need to entangle Jerry Britton
in the case, while allowing us to press the
cybersquatting claim.
