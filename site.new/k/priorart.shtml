 <!-- the content goes here -->
 
Patents can be challenged with "prior art".  What's needed is 
a <i>clear</i> demonstration to the court
that the <i>claimed</i> invention 
had been made earlier by somebody else.  Best is a published
example, but it's also useful to have examples from 
people who had built and demonstrated the claimed invention.

<P>
People have suggested a number of examples of prior art which we can use, 
but we are still looking for more.

<P>
A key part, however, is that prior art be exactly covered by
the claim:  Each part and step has to be present. For example,
consider claim 1 of the 
<A HREF="http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6530329-fulltext.html">6,530,329</a>
patent:
<blockquote>
1. A method of operating a digitally controlled model railroad comprising the steps of: 
<BR>
(a) transmitting a first command from a first program to an interface; 
<BR>
(b) transmitting a second command from a second program to said interface; and 
<BR>
(c) sending third and fourth commands from said interface representative of 
said first and second commands, respectively, to a digital command station. 
</blockquote>
<br/>

To be useful, prior art needs to demonstrate those three steps, in that order.
To make it a clear demonstration, we need a comparison written
down for presentation to the court.
And that's where we need help.
<P>

If you can spend some time writing one of these comparisons, please
<A HREF="mailto:jmri@pacbell.net">contact us by email<a/>.
We'll provide you with some examples and help getting started.
