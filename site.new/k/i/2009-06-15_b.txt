The 
<a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/">Software Freedom Legal Center</a>
has filed an amicus motion in our appeal to the Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit.

<p>
Actually, the process is that they file a
<a href="">motion</a> 
for permission to file the motion.
These are generally granted, as it's 
reasonable for the Court to get more information
when trying to resolve issues.

<p>
They've posted a 
<a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/news/2009/jun/15/jacobsen-amicus-brief/">note on their news feed</a>
descibing their position.
There's also a 
<a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/podcast/2009/jun/15/jacobsen-amicus-brief/">podcast episode</a>.
