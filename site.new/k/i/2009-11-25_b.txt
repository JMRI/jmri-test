The briefing papers for the December 4, 2009 
Summary Judgement hearing have all been filed.
<p>
There are two motions 
for Summary Judgement. In ours, we're requesting
that the Court find Katzer liable for cybersquatting and copyright infringement,
plus certain parts of the DMCA violation claim, and that the Court dismiss
Katzer's counter-claim that our decoder definition files infringe his copyright on the QSI manuals.
<p>
Katzer in turn is asking the Court to throw out our copyright claim, and since
there would then be no copyright infringement, the DMCA claim.  He didn't ask for 
a ruling on cybersquatting or his copyright counter-claim.

<p>
Each side filed their motion at about the same time, then filed "oppositions" to the
other's motions.  Finally, after getting approval from the Court, each side filed a 
"Reply" on a few specific points.  Each of these came with declarations and exhibits,
all of which are linked below.

<p>
In addition to these, there were a lot of procedural filings
that can be found on the complete <a href="/k/docket/index.shtml">docket page</a>.
These were needed because 
Katzer and QSI insisted that certain 
documents be sealed, and the parts of the 
arguments that refer to them be redacted from the 
public.  This in turn required various 
motions to the Court to reqeust orders to 
seal documents, etc.

<p>
The next step is the hearing on December 4th.  Before past hearings, the Court has
provided a preliminary ruling and/or a list of questions the day before.  If that happens
again, we'll post it as soon as possible.
