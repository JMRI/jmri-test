We had a hearing before the Judge on January 19th, 2007.
(<a href="/k/docket/172.pdf">Transcript</a>)
Two sets of issues were addressed:
<UL>
<LI>Katzer's 
<A href="/k/docket/index.shtml#motions2">motions</a> re the
Amended Complaint
to dismiss for failure 
to state a claim on which relief can be granted, 
motion to dismiss for failure to join a necessary 
party, motion to strike, and motion for a more definite statement.
<LI>Bob Jacobsen's 
<A href="/k/docket/index.shtml#preliminjunction1">motion for preliminary injunction</a>
to prevent further copyright violations
</UL>
The day before, the Court provided a 
<A href="/k/docket/147.pdf">Notice of Tentative Ruling and Questions</a>,
which provides some background for what was going to happen.
<P>
The Judge quizzed both sides about the <A href="/k/docket/147.pdf">questions</a> he'd previously provided. 
He then took the case under submission, which means he'll give his decision in a written ruling
at a later date. 
<P>
After that, there was a discussion of the scheduling of the next steps in the case, called a Case Management Conference. 
If you're interested in those details, there's some additional information in the 
<A href="/k/docket/">docket</a>, including 
the
<A href="/k/docket/index.shtml#146">proposed CMC</a>,
and 
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml#148">other documents</a>.
