We had a status and scheduling conference before Judge White on August 29th, 2008. 
He decided that both sides were to resubmit their motions to simplify the record. 
We'll then have a hearing on all matters on
December 19th, after which he'd rule on all the motions.
<p>
Included in this is our request for a preliminary injunction 
under copyright laws (infringement and DMCA)
to stop Katzer from misusing JMRI files, 
and Katzer's motions to remove 
various parts of our Second Amended Complaint against him.
<p>
All of the documents will be made available on the
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml">docket page</a>
after they are filed.
