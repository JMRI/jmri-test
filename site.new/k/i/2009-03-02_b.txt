On February 11, Katzer filed a 
<a href="/k/docket/290.pdf">counter-claim for $6 million</a>
because the JMRI decoder definition files 
infringe "his" copyright in a manual 
originally written for QSI to describe QSI's decoder.

<p>
The next step was for us to file an 
<a href="/k/docket/292.pdf">Answer</a>
to that claim, laying out our "defenses", which are the
reasons we think that counter-claim isn't legitimate.
We've done that today.

<p>
With this, and after only three years, the initial part of the
case now comes to a close.  Both sides have laid out the
basic structure of their case.  Now we move to the 2nd part,
where after some scheduling activities, the "discovery"
phase begins.  We'll provide more information as we get there.
