Normally, when one party makes a motion, the other party
gets to file an "Opposition", the original party gets to 
reply to that opposition, and that's it.  There's then
a hearing and the Court decides.  The side making the motion is supposed to put all
their arguments in the original motion.
<p>
In the case of two most recent motions, however,
Katzer raised new arguments in his replies.  
The only place we get a chance to refute those new arguments is
via a "surreply", but we have to ask the Court for permission to file that.
Because Katzer raised new arguments in his reply for each of two motions,
we've asked the court for permission to file a 
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml#217">surreply for the copyright motion</a> and a 
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml#215">surreply for the patent motion</a>.
These include the surreplies themselves
(<a href="/k/docket/217-2.pdf">copyright surreply</a>,
<a href="/k/docket/215-2.pdf">patent surreply</a>), if you'd like to read them.
