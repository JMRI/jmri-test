On December 28, 2007, a 
<a href="/k/docket/cafc-pi-1/ccc_mtn.pdf">motion to file an amicus brief</a>, 
along with the
<a href="/k/docket/cafc-pi-1/ccc_brf.pdf">brief itself</a>,
was filed in our appeal by
<ul>
<li>Creative Commons Corp, 
<li>The Linux Foundation,
<li>The Open Source Initiative, 
<li>The Software Freedom Law Center, 
<li>Yet Another Society (Perl Foundation), and 
<li>The Wikimedia Foundation.
</ul>
An "amicus brief" is a way for a "friend of the Court"
to explain to the Court the larger issues involved in a case.
They can be very helpful in making sure that decisions
with far-reaching consequences are made properly.
Here, the amici clearly laid
out how copyright protection is key to the success of open source and free software,
and educated the Court on why that matters.
It's a very strong argument, which should be widely read.
<p>
Katzer's deadline to oppose entry of this brief has now passed, and we hope that 
the Court will accept it soon.
