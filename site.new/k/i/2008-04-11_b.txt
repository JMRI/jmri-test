We had a hour-long hearing in the Northern District of 
California on April 11th, 2008.
It was nice to see so many supporters there!
<p>
The day before, the court had issued a
<a href="/k/docket/219.pdf">Notice of Tentative Ruling and Questions</a>
which indicated that the preliminary decision was to grant some parts
of the motions and deny others.  Much of the hearing was spent on the 
patent aspects of the case, but copyright also received some attention.
We'll post the transcript on the 
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml">docket page</a> and link to it from here as soon as it's available.

At the hearing, the Judge did not indicate what his decision will be.
We'll let you know as soon as we see it.
