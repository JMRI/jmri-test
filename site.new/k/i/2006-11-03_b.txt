On November 3, 2006, we filed an
<A href="/k/docket/123.pdf">opposition</a>
(basically, a rebuttal argument)
to Katzer's
<A HREF="2006-10-03.shtml">motion of September 28th</a>
in which he argues that copyright law shouldn't apply to his
theft of the JMRI files.
There are various technical elements involved, but the
most important parts are the sections defending
the use of copyright for protecting open-source software (pages 3 through 10).
The next steps were a reply from Katzer, due on November 17th, 
then a decision from the Court. We will probably have a tentative
ruling the day before the hearing (currently scheduled for January 19th, 2007), followed 
by the final ruling.
