Today, we filed a 
<a href="/k/docket/286.pdf">notice of appeal</a>, 
a preliminary step to appeal the recent 
<a href="/k/docket/284.pdf">District Court decision</a>.  
The next step is for the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to "docket" it, 
at which point we'll have a better idea of what the appellate schedule will be.

<p>
In the main case, the next scheduled event is the long-awaited Answer from Matt Katzer.
The Court has ordered him to provide it, 
and we're expecting to see it in the next few weeks.

<p>
After that, we have another 
<a href="/k/docket/285.pdf">settlement conference</a> scheduled with Judge Laporte
at the end of the month.   
A lot has happened since the last settlement conference a year ago, 
and we're cautiously optimistic that this one will be successful.

<p>
We'll post more information as it becomes available.
