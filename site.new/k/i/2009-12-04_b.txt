The Summary Judgement hearing took place today.

<p>
The hearing closely followed
the three questions provided 
in the 
"<a href="/k/docket/393.pdf">Notice of Tentative Ruling and Questions</a>"
issued yesterday:
<ul>
<li>
Is the question of originality of the copied work an issue of fact 
or an issue that can be resolved as a matter of law?  
Is there a dispute of fact regarding whether the selection 
and arrangement of data in the copied files is sufficiently original
to be copyrightable?
<li>
If the Court considers the expert reports submitted by Plaintiff, 
is there a dispute of fact 
regarding the damages allegedly sustained by Plaintiff?  
Regardless, does the Federal 
Circuit's holding in this matter, 535 F.3d 1373, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2008), 
as well as the 
testimony of Penny and Jacobsen indicate that Plaintiff suffered damages, 
even in the 
absence of a specific monetary figure?
<li>
Specifically where in the record is there a dispute of fact regarding whether the scope of 
QSI's permission was actually communicated to Plaintiff?
</ul>

<p>
The Court questioned both sides closely for about an hour.
(Unfortunately, due to Court rules, we won't be able to post the transcript for
about six months)
The next step will be a written ruling. We'll post
that as soon as we get it.
