On January 5, 2009, the Court 
<a href="/k/docket/284.pdf">ruled on all the pending motions</a>.
It was a mixed decision: The Court denied our request for a
preliminary copyright injunction, and granted some of Katzer's
motions but denied others. We're studying the implications of this ruling
and will provide more information when we can.
