We had a hearing before the Judge on December 19th, 2008. Three
motions were addressed:

<ul>
<li>Katzer's <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/k/docket/203.pdf">Motion to Dismiss</a> 
the patent actions for mootness

<li>Katzer's <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/k/docket/192.pdf">Motion to Dismiss</a>
the DMCA and contract causes of action, and strike certain damages

<li>Bob Jacobsen's <a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/k/docket/236.pdf">Motion for Preliminary Injunction</a> to prevent
further copyright violations
</ul>

Two days before, the Court provided a 
<a href="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/k/docket/279.pdf">Notice of Tentative Ruling and Questions</a>, 
which provided some background for what was going to
happen.

<p>
The Judge quizzed both sides about the questions he'd previously
provided, plus some additional questions. There was about 90 minutes
of discussion. He then took the case under submission, which means
he'll give his decision in a written ruling at a later date.
