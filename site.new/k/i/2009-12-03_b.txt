Today (December 3, 2009),
Court has issued it's 
"<a href="/k/docket/393.pdf">Notice of Tenatative Ruling and Questions</a>"
for the Summary Judgement hearing tomorrow (December 4).
<p>
This provides three questions that both sides will be asked to address:
<ul>
<li>
Is the question of originality of the copied work an issue of fact 
or an issue that can be resolved as a matter of law?  
Is there a dispute of fact regarding whether the selection 
and arrangement of data in the copied files is sufficiently original
to be copyrightable?
<li>
If the Court considers the expert reports submitted by Plaintiff, 
is there a dispute of fact 
regarding the damages allegedly sustained by Plaintiff?  
Regardless, does the Federal 
Circuit’s holding in this matter, 535 F.3d 1373, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2008), 
as well as the 
testimony of Penny and Jacobsen indicate that Plaintiff suffered damages, 
even in the 
absence of a specific monetary figure?
<li>
Specifically where in the record is there a dispute of fact regarding whether the scope of 
QSI’s permission was actually communicated to Plaintiff?
</ul>

Juries decide whether disputed facts are true.
Summary Judgement is a procedure where the Court can
rule on legal questions where all the facts are settled, and
therefore the facts don't need to go to the jury.
The Court will be looking for evidence on whether there is a 
real dispute about the facts, so that it can first rule 
whether facts are undisputed, and if so, decide
what they mean under the law.
