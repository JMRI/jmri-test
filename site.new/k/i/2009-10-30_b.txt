As expected,
both sides filed Motions for Summary Judgment today.
<p>
In 
<a href="/k/docket/343.pdf">our motion</a>, 
we're requesting
that the Court find Katzer liable for cybersquatting and copyright infringement,
plus certain parts of the DMCA violation claim, and that the Court dismiss
Katzer's counter-claim that our decoder definition files infringe his copyright on the QSI manuals.
<p>
<a href="/k/docket/352.pdf">Katzer's motion</a>
asks the Court to throw out our copyright claim, and since
there would then be no copyright infringement, the DMCA claim.  He didn't ask for 
a ruling on cybersquatting or his copyright counter-claim.

<p>
The next step is for both sides to provide "Opposition" briefs, due 
in several weeks.  Those will possibly be followed by "Replies", and
other documents, before the December 4th hearing.
