On September 13, 2007, we appealed the Court's ruling on copyright to the 
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington DC.  
Over the next few months, a series of briefs will be filed, first
by us, then a reply from Katzer and then a final brief from our side before
a (possible) hearing before the Appeals Court next Spring.

<p>
We've added a
<a href="/k/docket/cafc-pi-1/index.shtml">separate docket page</a>
for those who'd like to keep track of all the documents that will get filed.

<p>
This is an important part of the case, and we'd appreciate 
as much help as we can get.  
We're not just trying to get the Court's erroneous ruling
corrected for our own case, but because it's a very dangerous 
precedent for other open source and free software projects that
might find themselves in similar struggles against abuse.
Please, if you know people in open source organizations, suggest 
to them that they help with this.
