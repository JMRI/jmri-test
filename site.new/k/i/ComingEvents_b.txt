The next event in the case is a 
<a href="/k/docket/396.pd">settlement conference</a>
on January 28, 2010 in San Francisco. The outcome of that
will determine whether we go to trial on our appeal to the
Federal Circuit, and whether we have a trial in the main case.
We'll post more information as soon as we can.
