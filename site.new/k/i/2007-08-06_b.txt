As  
<A HREF"#decoderpro.com.1">described previously</A>, 
Matt Katzer
registered the decoderpro.com domain name to
prevent us from using our own trademark. 
He then transferred it to current registrant Jerry Britton 
through a settlement agreement which required Jerry Britton 
to pay $20,000 and Katzer's attorneys fees if Jerry transferred 
the domain name to JMRI.  When we
filed our Complaint with the court, we included a
claim for cybersquatting and a request that the
Judge order the return of that domain name.

<P>
Katzer's lawyers seized on that request, and
argued that because we'd not "joined all
necessary parties" -- that is, the current
registrant Jerry Britton who lives on the other
side of the country -- the judge had to dismiss
the whole cybersquatting claim. There is a legal
rule that a case has to include all people whose
interest might be seriously harmed, so that they
can have a say in the case. Katzer tried to use this rule 
to force us to either drag in Jerry
Britton, another model railroader who just wants
Katzer to leave him alone, or drop our request to
get our domain name back.

<P>
To avoid bringing Jerry in, and to get our domain
name back, we brought a proceeding under the
"<A HREF="http://www.icann.org/udrp/#udrp">Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy</a>" (UDRP). 
We filed a complaint with the World
Intellectual Property Organization, describing
Katzer's misbehavior and misuse of the
decoderpro.com domain name and asking them to
order that it be returned.

<P>
Focusing on Katzer's settlement agreement, the WIPO panel returned a 
<A HREF="http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2007/d2007-0763.html">decision</a>
that had an entire section on "Katzer's
Bad Faith", including:

<UL>
<LI>"Indeed, the evidence supports the conclusion
that Katzer had no purpose in registering the
name except to keep it out of others' hands,
including Complainant's hands."

<LI>"it is difficult to conceive of a legitimate
use Katzer could make of the Domain Name."

<LI>"In the Panel's view, there is essentially a
purpose on the part of Katzer to disrupt the
business of a competitor by interfering with
Complainant's exercise of his trademark rights."
</UL>
and ended with the statement that:
<UL>
<LI>"The Panel concludes that Complainant has
demonstrated sufficient evidence of bad faith
registration and use of the Domain Name on the
part of Katzer"
</UL>

The WIPO Panel then ordered the decoderpro.com
domain name transferred. 

<P>
It's undeniable -- this is a win for JMRI. An impartial
panel, experienced in Internet and trademark law,
has made a clear statement that Katzer had acted
in "bad faith". Although that's been clear to us
in the community since the beginning, having an
impartial panel ruling in our favor is a big step
toward holding Katzer accountable for his
actions. Further, it allowed us to continue to
press our cybersquatting complaint against
Katzer, and prevents Katzer from entangling Jerry
Britton in the case.
