<h2>JMRI Defense: Our Story So Far</h2>

This page describes the entire history, starting
from the beginning and going to the most recent
events.  It's a long story.
<p>
If you want just the most recent events, they're
also available on a 
<a href="Recent.shtml">shorter page</a>.
<p>
Other information and arrangements 
are available from the left-side menu.

<p>
The navigation bar to the left has links to more information, 
or you can go back to the 
<a href="/k/index.shtml">main page</a>
for an overview.

If you'd like to get email when we update these pages, please subscribe to the 
<A HREF="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-legal-announce">jmri-legal-announce</a>
mailing list at SourceForge.net.  
This will carry short announcements occasionally as news happens.
There won't be a lot of traffic. 
It's not a list for discussion and strategizing; for various reasons, 
we can't do that on a public list.
