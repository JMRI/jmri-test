    <h2>JMRI Donations</h2>
 
 <!-- the content goes here -->
 
JMRI runs entirely on volunteer labor. We have an 
impressive
<a href="/help/en/Acknowledgements.shtml">list of contributors</a>
in that respect.
<P>
Unfortunately, Matt Katzer has forced us to spend a lot
of money for trademark and copyright registrations, legal 
filing fees, court reporters, copies of official documents, etc.
<P>Patent, trademark and copyright litigation is expensive, and
the only way we have to offset those costs is to ask for donations.

<P>

</a> 
Please donate -- $5, $10, $25, $50, $100 or more -- to help us in this fight
by clicking on the button to the right.
The SourceForge/PayPal system completely shields your identity unless
you choose to provide it, and we keep no records of who has donated
(though we're grateful for every one, we don't want to risk
Katzer demanding the records and annoying even more model railroaders
and Open Source proponents)

<P>

When you donate, you can leave a comment. See below for a list
of the printable ones.
