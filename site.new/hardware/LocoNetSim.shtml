      <h1> 
      JMRI Hardware Guide: LocoNet Simulator
      </h1>

If JMRI is configured to use a Digitrax LocoNet connection, but
the connection isn't available, several aspects of the program will
not function.  This is because the program needs to interact with
the LocoNet during normal operation, and without the expected responses
from the LocoNet it will appear basically dead.
<P>
The "LocoNet Simulator" was created to make it possible to use JMRI
in a disconnected mode.  This is useful e.g. if you want to develop
a panel while away from your layout.
<P>
To use the LocoNet Simulator, select it as your lahyout connection in the
preferences, save the preferences, quit and restart the program.  You should
then be able to access LocoNet items such as Turnouts, Sensors, Signals, etc.
Some of the more advanced features, such as the BDL168 programmer, will 
not fully function, but you should be able to do all the steps to build
and edit panels.
<P>
When your computer is connected to the LocoNet again, you can change the
preferences to the proper connection, e.g. a LocoBuffer-USB, and use the panel
you've created.

<h2>Hex files</h2>
The simulator can also read and playback hex traces of LocoNet activity
to see how the program will react to them.  Each line in the trace is a 
single LocoNet packet in hexadecimal characters.  You can create one of these
by for example turnign on the "show raw data" option in a LocoNet Monitor window, and
having the monitor write to a log file. You'll have to edit the 
resulting file to remove the human readable lines, leaving just the
hex raw data.
