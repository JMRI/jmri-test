<P>
The LI101 Configuration tool is used to configure the LI101F.
<P>
Starting at the top:
<P>
The First drop down box selects the address the device will 
use on the XPressNet.  This address needs to be different than all other 
devices on your XPressNet.  
<P>
The Second drop down box sets the LI101F port speed.  This speed should 
match what you have used for the "Port Speed" setting in the preferences 
pane.
<P>
Starting on the Left side of the screen, the button labeled "Read from 
LI101", will read the current settings of the LI101F.
<P>
The button labeled "Write to LI101", will write the settings on the screen 
to the LI101F.  If you changed the LI101 Speed Setting, you will also need 
to change the speed setting in your preferences.
<P>
The button labeled "Reset to Factory Defaults" will reset the <b>screen</b> 
to factory defaults.  This does not send a reset instruction to the LI101F at 
this point in time.
<P>
The last button, labeled "Close" will close the screen, without sending 
any information to the LI101F.
