	JMRI Hardware Guide: XPressNet
</H1>

<H2>Overview</H2>
    <p>XPressNet is the Command Bus used by <a 
	href="http://www.atlasrr.com">Atlas</a>,<a 
	href="http://www.lenz.com">Lenz</a>,<a 
	href="http://www.ztccontrols.com">ZTC Controls</a>, and <a 
	href="http://www.roco.co.at">Roco</a>.
    It was developed by Lenz.  The XPressNet specification (available from
    the Lenz website) specifies the electrical communications standards and
    command set needed for devices to communicate with the command station.
    While the command stations support the same commands over the XPressNet
    connection, they do not all use the same connectors.  It may be necessary
    to build an adapter to plug a device into a command station from another
    manufacturer.  </p> 

<H2>Supported Hardware</H2>

<H3>Command Stations</H3>

<p>The XPressNet protocol allows the DCC manufacturers that use it to 
select what functionality they wish to provide in thier command stations.
This functionality ranges from "supports all features" to "bare bones 
minimal".  Unfortunatly, this restricts the features you can access via 
JMRI - if the hardware doesn't support it, it isn't there to be used by 
JMRI.</p>

<p>In general, the features that JMRI cares about can be grouped into four
areas - operating locomotives and turnouts on the layout, programming decoders
on a programming track or in ops mode, and getting feedback from the layout
(the state of turnouts, ops-mode feedback, etc).  The following table tries to
show what systems support these features.  System specific limitations 
are also expressed in the <a href=#Limitations>Limitations</a> section of 
this page</p>

<H3>Computer Interfaces</H3>

    <p>There are four computer interfaces that JMRI has been tested with, and
    developed for
    	<ul>
	<li>The Lenz LI100 is Lenz's original computer interface.  It is
	limited to a serial port speed of 9600 baud.  
	<li>The Lenz LI100F is an improved version of the LI100.  It supports
	serial port speeds of 9600 and 19,200 baud.  The Factory default is
	9600 baud.
	<li>The Lenz LI101 is Lenz's latest computer interface.  It is
	significantly different than the LI100 and LI100F in physical
	apearance, and in the method by which the device is configured.  The
	device is configured via a softwaretool provided by Lenz which runs on
	Windows only.  We have included a configuration tool with JMRI that
	will allow users of other operating systems to configure thier LI101 as
	well.  The LI101 supports serial port speeds of 19,200, 38,400, 57,600,
	and 115,200 baud.  The factory default is 19,200 baud
	<li>In addition to the Lenz purpose built computer interfaces, we have
	also included support for using an XPressNet Phone Adapter (XPA) as an
	interface to the an XPressNet based DCC system.  This interface is
	relatively slow, and it only allows controlling mobile and stationary
	decoders, but it may be perfect for someone who is interested in trying
	out the control functions of a computer before deciding to go with a
	full fledged interface.
	</ul></p>

<a name=Limitations>
<H2>Limitations</H2>
<div class=list>
    <dl>
    	<dt class=left>JMRI</dt>
	<dd class=first>
	<p>JMRI supports the current version (XBus/XPressNet Version 3.0).  We
	may add XBus Version 1.0 and 2.0 support in the future which will allow
	all XBus based systems to work with JMRI.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt class=left>Atlas</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The Atlas Commander provides support only for operation of 
	equipment on a layout (running trains and throwing switches)
	from JMRI.</p>

	<p>If you have an Atlas Commander, and would like to use it 
        to control your layout from the computer, an XPA and Hayes 
        Compatible Modem may be a more cost effective solution than the 
	LI100,LI100F, or LI101F</p>

	</dd>

	<dt class=left>Lenz</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>We have a pretty good handle on what instructions each Lenz Command
	station should support. If you find that you cannot perform a function you
	think you should be able to using a Lenz system and the LI100 or LI101F,
	Please let us know.</p>

	<p>LZ100 and LZV100 based systems support the full range of JMRI 
        functionality.  The LZ100 is the command station used in the 
	Set-01.  The LZV100 is the command station used in the Set-90,
	Set-100, and Set-LI.</p>

	<p>The LH200 provides support only for operating equipment on a layout 
	(running trains and throwing switches) from JMRI.  The LH200 is the 
	command station used in the Set-02</p>

	<p>The Compact is the same device as the Atlas Commander, and 
	has the same restrictions as the commander.  The Compact is not 
	available in North America</p>

	<p>If you have either an LH200 or a Compact, and wish to add 
	computer control to your layout, an XPA and Hayes Compatible 
	Modem may be a more cost effective solution than the LI100, 
	LI100F, or LI101F</p>
	
	</dd>
	<dt class=left>Roco</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The Roco LocoMaus 2 (Roco Part number 10760) has been shown to 
	support operating equipment on a layout (running trains and throwing 
	switches) as well as programming locomotives on the programming 
	track.</p>  
	<p>It is not known at this point in time if the LocoMaus 2 
	supports Operations Mode Programming.</p>

	<p>The LocoMaus 2 does not support feedback.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt class=left>ZTC</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The ZTC Controls ZTC511 and ZTC521 (both with XPressNet V3.0 
	software) have yet to be tested, so the full extent of what is 
	supported is not known at this time.</p>

	<p>The onboard serial interface of the ZTC511 is not supported at 
	this point in time.</p>

	<p>You can use any of the interfaces listed above to connect to a 
	ZTC system that supports the XPressNet V3.0 protocol.</p>

	</dd>
    	<dt class=left>XPA and Hayes Compatible Modem</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>If you choose to use an XPA and a Hayes Compatible Modem to 
	control your XPressNet based system, you will be limited to 
	control of locomotives and accessory decoders, regardless of what 
	features your system supports if it is connected via an LI100, 
	LI100F, or LI101F</p>

<H2>Connectiong to an XPressNEt based DCC System using a Lenz LI100 or LI101</H2>
<ol>
    <li><p> To connect your computer to one of these XPressNet based DCC systems, you
    need a Lenz LI100 or LI101 interface unit.  Connect one of those units to your
    DCC command station via their XpressNet connections.  Then connect the
    LI100/LI101 to the computer's serial port using a 9-pin serial cable.</p>

    <li><P> Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program.  This
    opens automatically the first time a program is run, or you can
    select it from the "Edit" menu.  </p>

    <li><P> Select "Lenz XPressNet" from the top selection box. You can
    then select the proper serial port in the second selection box.
    </p>

    <li><P> The baud rate selection box should be set to match your LI100
    or LI101.  From the factory, the LI100 is set to 9600 baud, The
    LI101 is set to 19,200 baud.</p>

    <li><P> The fourth box should be left on "hardware flow control" unless
    you later consistently get a message about the LI100 control leads
    being improperly set up, in which case you might want to try to
    bypass that by selecting "no flow control".</p>

    <li><P> The series of radio buttons labelled "GUI style" allows you to
    select how the program will look.  "Metal" is the native Java look
    available on all types.  Other choices will vary with your computer
    type. "Motif", "Windows", "MacOS" and "MacOS Adaptive" look native
    on Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic" and MacOS X respectively.</p>

    <li><P> In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default
    programmer format. You can override this each time you open the
    programmer, so this is here just for convenience.</p>

    <li><P> Click "Save".  You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to
    quit, click "Yes".</p>

    <li><P> Restart the program. You should be up and running.</p>
</ol>


<H2>Connectiong to an XPressNet based DCC System using the XPA and a modem</H2>

<p>We have developed an alternative method for connecting to an XPressNet based
   system which should prove to be more cost effective on XPressNet based
   systems that do not support programming or feedback via the LI100,LI100F, or
   LI101F computer interfaces, or for those who are interested in experimenting
   with computer control, but don't need all the features supported by the Lenz
   interfaces.</p>

<p>This system uses the Lenz XPressNet Phone Adapter and a Hayes Compatible
   modem to provide control of locomotives and stationary decoders. </p>

<ol>
    <li> Connect your computer to a Hayes Compatible modem - either a built-in
    	modem card or an external serial modem.

    <li>Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program. This opens
    automatically the first time a program is run, or you can select it from
    the "Edit" menu.

    <li>Select "XPA-Modem" from the top selection box. You can then select the
    proper serial port in the second selection box.

    <li>The baud rate selection box should default to 9600 baud. At this point
    in time, this can not be changed.

    <li>The series of radio buttons labelled "GUI style" allows you to select
    how the program will look. "Metal" is the native Java look available on all
    types. Other choices will vary with your computer type. "Motif", "Windows",
    "MacOS" and "MacOS Adaptive" look native on Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic"
    and MacOS X respectively.

    <li>In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default programmer
    format. You can override this each time you open the programmer, so this is
    here just for convenience.

    <li>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to quit, click "Yes".

    <li>Restart the program. You should be up and running.
