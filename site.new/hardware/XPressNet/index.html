	JMRI Hardware Guide: XPressNet
</H1>

<H2>Supported Hardware</H2>

<p>The various DCC manufacturers that use XPressNet in their products all
implement varying degrees of functionality, ranging from "supports all
features" to "bare bones minimal".  Unfortunatly, this restricts the
features you can access via JMRI - if the hardware doesn't support it,
it isn't there to be used by JMRI.</p>

<p>In general, the features that JMRI cares about can be grouped into three
areas - operating locomotives and turnouts on the layout, programming decoders
on a programming track or in ops mode, and getting feedback from the layout
(the state of turnouts, ops-mode feedback, etc).  The following table tries to
show what systems support these features.</p>

<H2>Overview</H2>
    <p>XPressNet is the Command Bus used by <a 
	href="http://www.atlasrr.com">Atlas</a>,<a 
	href="http://www.lenz.com">Lenz</a>,<a 
	href="http://www.ztccontrols.com">ZTC Controls</a>, and <a 
	href="http://www.roco.co.at">Roco</a>.</p>
	
    <p> It was developed by Lenz.  The XPressNet specification (available from
    the Lenz website) specifies the electrical communications standards and
    command set needed for devices to communicate with the command station.
    While the command stations support the same commands over the XPressNet
    connection, they do not all use the same connectors.  It may be necessary
    to build an adapter to plug a device into a command station from another
    manufacturer.  </p> 

    <p>There are Three computer interfaces that JMRI has been tested with, and
    developed for
    	<ul>
	<li>The Lenz LI100 is Lenz's original computer interface.  It is
	limited to a serial port speed of 9600 baud.  
	<li>The Lenz LI100F is an improved version of the LI100.  It supports
	serial port speeds of 9600 and 19,200 baud.  The Factory default is
	9600 baud.
	<li>The Lenz LI101 is Lenz's latest computer interface.  It is
	significantly different than the LI100 and LI100F in physical
	apearance, and in the method by which the device is configured.  The
	device is configured via a softwaretool provided by Lenz which runs on
	Windows only.  We have included a configuration tool with JMRI that
	will allow users of other operating systems to configure thier LI101 as
	well.  The LI101 supports serial port speeds of 19,200, 38,400, 57,600,
	and 115,200 baud.  The factory default is 19,200 baud</p>
	<li>In addition to the Lenz purpose built computer interfaces, we have
	also included support for using an XPressNet Phone Adapter (XPA) as an
	interface to the an XPressNet based DCC system.  This interface is
	relatively slow, and it only allows controlling mobile and stationary
	decoders, but it may be perfect for someone who is interested in trying
	out the control functions of a computer before deciding to go with a
	full fledged interface.
	</ul></p>

<H2>Limitations</H2>
<div class=list>
    <dl>
    	<dt class=left>JMRI</dt>
	<dd class=first>
	<p>JMRI supports the current version (XBus/XPressNet Version 3.0).  We
	may add XBus Version 1.0 and 2.0 support in the future which will allow
	all XBus based systems to work with JMRI.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt class=left>Atlas</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The Atlas Commander supports X-Bus - AKA XPressNet - a high-speed
	digital network based upon the industry standard RS-485
	protocol.  The Atlas Commander uses XpressNET to communicate
	between its high-speed components such as the HandCommand.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, the Atlas Commander will not accept programming
	commands via its XPressNet connection. This means that DecoderPro
	can't program decoders via a LI100 and Atlas Commander.</p>

	<p>There doesn't appear to be anything we can do about this as it
	is a limitation of the Atlas hardware.</p>

	<p>You can still operate your layout via the JMRI libraries with an
	Atlas Commander and LI100, but it's not a very cost-effective
	approach.  See below for a lower-cost alternative.</p>
	</dd>

	<dt class=left>Lenz</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The situation with connecting to a Lenz system is somewhat confusing.
	The Lenz LI100 interface will allow your computer to talk to XPressNet,
	but not all Lenz systems can use XPressNet communications for all
	functions.  </p>

	<p>As far as we know only the LZ-100 in combination with the LH-90 or
	LH-100 allows programming from the XPressNet. Note that the LZ-100 is
	also integrated in the sets 01, 90 and 100.</p>

	<p>On the other hand, the LH200 handheld from Set 02 can make an
	XPressNet connection with a computer via an LI100, but will not accept
	programming instructions over that connection. This means that
	DecoderPro cannot program decoders through a Lenz Set 02.</p>

	<p>We don't actually know what the restrictions of the various Lenz
	systems are with respect to XPressNet and the LI100. You should contact
	Lenz or your local dealer for information before investing in an LI100.

<H2>Connectiong to an XPressNEt based DCC System using a Lenz LI100 or LI101</H2>
<ol>
    <li><p> To connect your computer to one of these XPressNet based DCC systems, you
    need a Lenz LI100 or LI101 interface unit.  Connect one of those units to your
    DCC command station via their XpressNet connections.  Then connect the
    LI100/LI101 to the computer's serial port using a 9-pin serial cable.</p>

    <li><P> Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program.  This
    opens automatically the first time a program is run, or you can
    select it from the "Edit" menu.  </p>

    <li><P> Select "Lenz XPressNet" from the top selection box. You can
    then select the proper serial port in the second selection box.
    </p>

    <li><P> The baud rate selection box should be set to match your LI100
    or LI101.  From the factory, the LI100 is set to 9600 baud, The
    LI101 is set to 19,200 baud.</p>

    <li><P> The fourth box should be left on "hardware flow control" unless
    you later consistently get a message about the LI100 control leads
    being improperly set up, in which case you might want to try to
    bypass that by selecting "no flow control".</p>

    <li><P> The series of radio buttons labelled "GUI style" allows you to
    select how the program will look.  "Metal" is the native Java look
    available on all types.  Other choices will vary with your computer
    type. "Motif", "Windows", "MacOS" and "MacOS Adaptive" look native
    on Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic" and MacOS X respectively.</p>

    <li><P> In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default
    programmer format. You can override this each time you open the
    programmer, so this is here just for convenience.</p>

    <li><P> Click "Save".  You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to
    quit, click "Yes".</p>

    <li><P> Restart the program. You should be up and running.</p>
</ol>


<H2>Connectiong to an XPressNEt based DCC System using the XPA and a modem</H2>

<p>We have developed an alternative method for connecting to an XPressNet based
   system which should prove to be more cost effective on XPressNet based
   systems that do not support programming or feedback via the LI100,LI100F, or
   LI101F computer interfaces, or for those who are interested in experimenting
   with computer control, but don't need all the features supported by the Lenz
   interfaces.</p>

<p>This system uses the Lenz XPressNet Phone Adapter and a Hayes Compatible
   modem to provide control of locomotives and stationary decoders. </p>

<ol>
    <li> Connect your computer to a Hayes Compatible modem - either a built-in
    	modem card or an external serial modem.

    <li>Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program. This opens
    automatically the first time a program is run, or you can select it from
    the "Edit" menu.

    <li>Select "XPA-Modem" from the top selection box. You can then select the
    proper serial port in the second selection box.

    <li>The baud rate selection box should default to 9600 baud. At this point
    in time, this can not be changed.

    <li>The series of radio buttons labelled "GUI style" allows you to select
    how the program will look. "Metal" is the native Java look available on all
    types. Other choices will vary with your computer type. "Motif", "Windows",
    "MacOS" and "MacOS Adaptive" look native on Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic"
    and MacOS X respectively.

    <li>In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default programmer
    format. You can override this each time you open the programmer, so this is
    here just for convenience.

    <li>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to quit, click "Yes".

    <li>Restart the program. You should be up and running.
