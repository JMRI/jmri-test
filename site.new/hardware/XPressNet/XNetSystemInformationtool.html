<P>
The XPressNet System Information tool is used to determine what hardware 
is connected to the system.
<P>
The top two lines indicate the Command Station type and software 
version that is connected to through your computer.  
This information is read as part of the auto configuration process when 
JMRI first starts, but can be re-read using the "Get System Info" button.
<P>
After the line reading Interface, the hardware and software version of the 
Computer interface is displayed.  These are obtained by the "Get System 
Info" 
<P>
The image on this page shows the results obtained by pressing the "Get 
System Info" button with a Software version 2 LI101F connected to an atlas 
Commander with software 3.2.
<P>
The button labeled "Close" will close the screen.
