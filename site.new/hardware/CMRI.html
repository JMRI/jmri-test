	<H3>Supported Hardware</H3>

	<UL>
	<li>Chubb C/MRI USIC
	<li>Chubb C/MRI SMINI
	<li>Chubb C/MRI SUSIC
	<li>TracTronics
	</UL>

	<H3>Limitations</H3>

	<p>The JMRI libraries have built-in support for C/MRI serial hardware
	using the USIC, SUSIC and SMINI.
	C/MRI inputs can be used as sensors, and outputs can be driven as
	turnouts.</p>

	<p>At this time, the directly connected IBEC and UBEC interfaces are
	not supported.</p>

	<dl>
	<dt class=left>Use with an SMINI board</dt>
	<dd class=top>
	    <p>It's easiest to try JMRI with a SMINI board, as there's no
	    options to be configured for the C/MRI hardware.
	    <ol>
		<li>Start the JMRIdemo program
		<li>From the edit menu, select preferences and configure:
	        <ul>
		    <li>Protocol as "C/MRI serial"
		    <li>For serial port, select the one your hardware is attached to.
		    <li>Select the baud rate your C/MRI system uses
		    <li>Click the "Configure C/MRI nodes" button. On the
		        new panel that opens:
		        <UL>
		        <LI>Enter a node address (0 is typically used for the first card)
    		    <li>Select "SMINI" from the initialization box
    		    <li>Click "Add Node"
    		    <LI>Click "Done"
    		    </ul>
		    <li>Back on the "Preferences..." panel, click "Save", and say yes when it asks if you want to quit.
	        </ul>
		<li>Restart the program. Your SMINI's red and yellow
		LEDs should now be flashing, indicating that the computer and
		SMINI are talking.
		<li>To check that everything is working, select "Turnout
		Control" from the tools menu.  This will open a small window in
		which you can select a turnout number (<a href="#numbers">see
		below</a>), then click closed/thrown to change the state of
		that output.
	    </ol>
	</dd>

	<dt class=left>Use with other C/MRI hardware</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>A C/MRI system needs an initialization string before it can
	communicate. The program will automatically create that, but
	you need to specify the details of how your C/MRI hardware
	is set up.  To do this:
	    <ol>
		<li>Start the JMRIdemo program
		<li>From the edit menu, select preferences and configure:
	        <ul>
		    <li>Protocol as "C/MRI serial"
		    <li>For serial port, select the one your hardware is attached to.
		    <li>Select the baud rate your C/MRI system uses
		    <li>Click the "Configure C/MRI nodes" button. On the
		        new panel that opens:
		        <UL>
		        <LI>Enter a node address (0 is typically used for the first card)
                <LI>Select "USIC_SUIC" in the "node type box". 
                <LI>Leave DL at zero.
                <LI>Select "24-bit" or "32-bit" in "Card size", depending
                    on whether you have the original 24 bit or newer 32 bit 
                    DI and DO cards.
                <LI> Configure your cards in the table below that.  
                    For each card you've got installed, click where it 
                    says "No Card" and select "Input 
                    Card" or "Output Card"    		    
                <li>Click "Add Node"
    		    <li>If you have additional nodes, you can enter their address
    		    and repeat the process now.  To make debugging
    		    simpler if anything goes wrong, it might be better to just get
    		    one working at first, and come back later to add the rest of the nodes.
    		    <LI>Click "Done"
    		    </ul>
		    <li>Back on the "Preferences..." panel, click "Save", and say yes when it asks if you want to quit.
	        </ul>
		<li>Restart the program. The transmit and receive
		LEDs on your C/MRI controller should now be flashing, indicating that the computer and
		controller are talking.
		<li>To check that everything is working, select "Turnout
		Control" from the tools menu.  This will open a small window in
		which you can select a turnout number (<a href="#numbers">see
		below</a>), then click closed/thrown to change the state of
		that output.
	    </ol>
	
	</dd>

	<dt class=left><a name=signals>Wiring Signals</a></dt>
	<dd>
    JMRI can work with all the popular ways of wiring 
    signals to C/MRI hardware (and there are a lot of them!)
    For information on how to configure your signals to the
    program, please see the 
    <A HREF="cmri/Signals.html">C/MRI signals</a> page.
    </dd>
    
    
	<dt class=left><a name=numbers>Numbering</a></dt>
	<dd>
	<p>C/MRI system names start with "C". For example, "CS24" is a C/MRI
	"S"ensor, the 24th input line.</p>

	<p>Inputs and outputs are numbered sequentially from 1, without
	worrying about the types of cards, etc. For example, if you have two
	24-input cards, CS25 refers to the 1st input line on the second card.
	If you have two 32 input cards, CS25 refers to the 25th input line on
	the first card.</p>

	<p>Each SMINI, USIC or SUSIC is called a "node". Sensors and turnouts
	on the first node are numbered from 1 to 999; sensors and turnouts on
	the second node are numbered 1001 to 1999; etc. </p>
	
	<P>For example:
	<UL>
	<LI>Say you have a SMINI with it's address switches set to "2". All of the
	inputs and outputs on that node will be numbered starting with 2001.  
	    <UL>
	    <LI>CT2001 is the first output pin
	    <LI>CT2048 is the last output pin
	    <LI>CS2001 is the first input pin
	    <LI>CS2024 is the last output pin.
	    </UL>
	<LI>If you have a USIC with it's address switches set to "1", it will
	have all it's inputs and outputs numbered starting with 1001.  If it has
	three 24-bit input cards, and two 24-bit output cards, their addresses will be:
	    <UL>
	    <LI>CT1001 is the first pin on the 1st output card
	    <LI>CT1024 is the last pin on the 1st output card
	    <LI>CT1025 is the first pin on the 2nd output card
	    <LI>CT1048 is the last pin on the 2nd output card
	    <LI>CS1001 is the first pin on the 1st input card
	    <LI>CS1024 is the last pin on the 1st input card
	    <LI>CS1025 is the first pin on the 2nd input card
	    <LI>CS1049 is the first pin on the 3rd input card
	    <LI>CS1072 is the last pin on the 3rd input card
	    </UL>
	Note that it doesn't matter what order the cards are installed, etc. That's
	all configured when you put together the hardware, and when you define
	the C/MRI preferences to the program (see above). 
	<LI>Is you have a SUSIC with it's address switches set to "4", the inputs
	and outputs will be numbered starting with 4001.  If it has two 32-bit input
	and two 32-bit output
	cards, their addresses will be:
	    <UL>
	    <LI>CT1001 is the first pin on the 1st output card
	    <LI>CT1032 is the last pin on the 1st output card
	    <LI>CT1033 is the first pin on the 2nd output card
	    <LI>CT1064 is the last pin on the 2nd output card
	    <LI>CS1001 is the first pin on the 1st input card
	    <LI>CS1032 is the last pin on the 1st input card
	    <LI>CS1033 is the first pin on the 2nd input card
	    <LI>CS1064 is the last pin on the 3rd input card
	    </UL>
	
	</UL>

    <P>To summarize, input and output pins are labelled sequentially
    within each C/MRI node.  The numbers go up by 1000 from node to 
    node.  Node numbers can go as high as the C/MRI hardware allows.
