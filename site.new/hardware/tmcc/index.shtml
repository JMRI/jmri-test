      </h1>

	<h2>Supported Systems</h2>

    (To be written)
    	  
	<h2>Setup</h2>

	  <p>First, connect your computer's serial port to the TMCC
	  command station using a serial cable.  This should be a "straight-through"
	  or "modem" cable, <I>not</I>a "crossover" or "null-modem" cable.
	  if your computer doesn't have a built-in serial port, you can
	  use a USB-serial adapter, but make sure you install the correct
	  drivers.

      <P>
      Next, configure the program.
      <UL>
      <LI>Start your JMRI-based program (DecoderPro, PanelPro, etc).
	  <li> Go to the preferences panel of the program.
	  This opens automatically the first time a program is run, or you
	  can select it from the "Edit" menu.  </li>

	  <li> Select "TMCC (Lionel)" from the top
	  selection box.</li>
	  
	  <LI>In the second selection box, pick the name of the 
	  serial port that you have connected to the TMCC system.</li>

	  <li> If the baud rate doesn't show a fixed value, set it to 
	  9600 baud.</li>

	  <li> The series of radio buttons labelled "GUI style" allows you
	  to select how the program will look.  "Metal" is the native Java
	  look available on all types.  Other choices will vary with your
	  computer type. "Motif", "Windows", "MacOS" and "MacOS Adaptive"
	  look native on Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic" and MacOS X
	  respectively.</li>

	  <li> In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default
	  programmer format. You can override this each time you open the
	  programmer, so this is here just for convenience.</li>

	  <li> Click "Save".  You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to
	  quit, click "Yes".</li>

	  <li> Restart the program. You should be up and running.</li>
	  </ul>


	<h2>Features and Limitations</h2>

    (Not yet complete)
    
    <P>
    With JMRI 1.7.3, Lionel TMCC operation for engines and 
    accessory decoders is available.  The train commands are not
    yet available.
    
    <P>
    When using a JMRI throttle to run an engine, the function buttons
    are allocated:
    <DL>
    <DT>F0<DD>Headlight (AUX2)
    <DT>F1<DD>Bell
    <DT>F2<DD>Horn/Whistle 1
    <DT>F3<DD>Front Coupler
    <DT>F4<DD>Back Coupler
    </DL>

    <P>
    The next JMRI version will provide additional functions, and the ability
    to remap them to your preferences.
