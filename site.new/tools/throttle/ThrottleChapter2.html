		<P>This chapter will walk you through the process of opening up a new throttle window
		and then configuring it to run a locomotive on your layout.  For the purposes of this
		user guide, we will be using a locomotive that has been equipped with a sound decoder.
		The decoder's address in our examples here is <B>8251</B>.  If you are following along
		with a locomotive of your own while you read this, simply replace your loco's decoder
		address anywhere that "8251" is shown.</P>
			
		<P>So let's get started.</P>

						<P>Now that you have established an address for the throttle, you should be able
						to run the train on your layout (if your layout is active and the address you
						entered is valid to a locomotive on the track).  You do this using the
						"<B>Control Panel</B>" (see Figure 2-5).  But here is where things get a
						little sticky.</P>
								
						<P>There are multiple combinations of DCC systems and computer platforms that
						make up for slight differences in the functionality of the throttles.
						The programmers are working hard at trying to get these throttles to function
						identically.  But because of the these differences, you may discover that not
						everything noted in the following text will function as defined for your system.</P>

						<P class="important">
						<B>Important!</B> &nbsp; 
						The "Control Panel" must have the "focus" for it to become
						active (and usable).  In other words, it's window bar must be active.  If
						you are following along with this text with your own locomotive and just
						entered an address in the Address Panel, you will discover that the Address
						Panel is the window with the current focus.  None of the keyboard or mouse
						actions described below will move the train until the Control Panel has the
						focus.  To make the Control Panel the active window, use your mouse pointer
						to click somewhere within the Control Panel.

						immediately get frustrated with the throttles because they can't get their loco
						to move — not realizing that the Control Panel does not have the focus.

					<P>The slider bar can function differently for each user depending on several

					that the slider bar can work.  At least one of these methods should work for
					you.  You may discover that your setup can utilize more than one of these.
					A little experimentation on your part may be required.</P>

						<LI><STRONG>Slider Method 1</STRONG>
							<UL>
								<LI>Clicking anywhere above the current slider pointer position will
								INCREASE the loco speed by 1 speed step.  For example, if the
								locomotive's current speed setting was 23, then a single click will
								advance the speed to 24.  Another click will increase the speed to
								25.  Another click...to speed step 26.  Another...to speed step 27.
								And so on...until it reaches the maximum speed steps for your
								system.  This action has the same effect as using the <BIG>+</BIG>
								key on the numeric keypad.<BR><BR>
										
								<LI>Clicking anywhere below the current slider pointer position will
								DECREASE the loco speed by 1 speed step.  For example, if the
								locomotive's current speed setting is 21, then a single click will
								decrease the speed to 20.  Another click will decrease the speed to
								20.  Another click...to speed step 19.  And so on...until it reaches

							(STOP!) — but the word "Stop" located at the lower end of
							the speed slider.

								positioned near approximately the 75% point the slider bar when

		    <P>When the decoder address is first "<BIG>Set</BIG>", the software queries the current
			status of the decoder.  This includes the current direction of the locomotive, its current
			speed, and what function buttons are on or off.  The software will set the current
			direction indicator and identify any functions that are "active" (in the "on" state).
			But, if the loco is moving, the loco's speed is not established on the Speed Control
			slider bar.</P>
							
			<P class="important">
			<B>Note:</B> &nbsp; At this time, the slider bar does <U>not</U> automatically correspond
			to the actual speed.  This is important to understand because of what action you are
			going to see when you first click on the speed slider bar.  When you first "<BIG>Set</BIG>"
			a decoder address, the slider bar is set to the zero (0) position.  So if you acquired
			a locomotive that is actually moving and you click on the slider bar, it is going to set
			the speed to zero (or wherever you click and set the slider bar pointer).<BR><BR>

			A future enhancement of the throttle feature will be to synchronize the slider bar pointer
			accordingly.  Until then, just beware of this little reaction.
