<H1>Show NCE Cabs</H1>
<P>
	This tool provides a list of the NCE cabs connected to your NCE command station.
	Up to 63 cabs can be connected, the type of cabs are ProCab, Cab04, USB, and AIU.
	The tool also provides each cab's active locomotive address, speed, consist number,
	and which locomotive functions are active.
</P>
<P>
    The display has three lines for each cab.
    The functions display as check marks in three rows, F0 through F9 on the first row,
    F10 through F19 on the second row and F20 through F28 on the third row.
    The two lines of the cab display text are also shown.
</P>
<P>
	The monitor will read the current cab information when the tool is first selected.
	It will then update the list when the "Refresh" button is pressed or if a cab address
	is purged. It does take a number of seconds to request all the information for an
	active cab. On layouts with lots of active cabs it will take a number of seconds
	to update.
</P> 
<P>
	To help manage cabs on very large layouts the display will show the last time a cab
	was seen as active and changed settings.
	Hitting the "Purge" button on a line for a cab address will mark it as in-active
	and remove it from the active list.
	This is expected to improve the keystroke response on the remaining cabs
	as the command station will not have to timeout waiting for a response from
	the purged cab address.
</P>
