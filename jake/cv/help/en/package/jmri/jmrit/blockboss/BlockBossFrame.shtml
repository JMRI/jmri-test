<a name="contents"><h2>Contents</h2></a>

<p>The documentation below describes Signaling with JMRI, and discusses how to set 
up the basic signal situations. The documentation is divided into sections; click below for 
easy access to a listed section. If you prefer to try before reading much,
read <a href="#intro">Introduction to SSL</a>,

<a name="terms"><h2>Vocabulary</h2></a>

<p>Some basic signal terms:
<dl>
<dt><b>Signal Arm</b> or <b>Signal Head</b><dd>Each individual signal unit.

<dt><b>Aspect</b><dd>The speed or route indication given by one or more signal heads or arms.

<dt><b>Marker</b> <dd>A signal head or arm that does not change color or position.

<dt><b>Light</b> <dd>The individual lamp in a signal. A light may indicate multiple aspects
if it changes color like  in a searchlight signal, or it may take multiple lights
to indicate a single aspect, for example in position light signals.

<dt><b>Mast</b> <dd>The pole that mounts one or more signal arms that (usually) control each
individual track.
<dt><b>Distant Signal</b> <dd>A distant signal shows the same or 
more restrictive aspect as the next signal in the direction and route of travel.
</dl>
	
<p>Some JMRI specific SSL and Signal terms:

<dl>
<dt><b>Signal Head Table</b> <dd>The list of signals in JMRI. Signals must first be added into 
the Signal Head Table before they may be included in a SSL entry or Logix.

<dt><b>Triple Output</b> 
<dd>A signal head that has each aspect of the signal directly driven 
from an individual output (called a turnout) line. 
Each aspect change requires that three commands be sent.

<dt><b>Triple Output RGB</b> 
<dd>A signal head that uses just three output lines to indicate 5 signal aspects.
Usually these aspects will be Clear, Approach, Stop, Restricting and Dark. 
The output coding is such that 
one turnout thrown (on) controls the stop and another thrown (on) controls the clear. 
Both of these outputs thrown (on) controls the
approach, all three on controls the restricting, and all three closed (off) are dark. 
Each aspect change requires that three commands be sent.

<dt><b>Double Output</b> 
<dd>A signal head that uses just two output lines to indicate 4 signal aspects.
Usually these aspects will be Clear, Approach, Stop, and Dark. 
The output coding is such that 
one turnout thrown (on) controls the stop and the other thrown (on) controls the clear. 
Both outputs thrown (on) controls the
approach, and both closed (off) are dark. 
Each aspect change requires that two commands be sent.

<dt><b>SE8c</b> <dd>A signal head controlled by a single turnout command per aspect change. 
One turnout command changes between 
stop and clear, and the second turnout command changes between approach and dark.

<dt><b>Virtual</b> <dd>Virtual signals are JMRI internal signals with no actual hardware attached. 
Before the advent of Logix,
Virtual Signals were required to solve more complex operations than can be done with with a single SSL alone.

<dt><b>Protected Sensor</b> <dd>The next block sensor/s following the signal you are controlling in the 
direction and route of travel. 
The "protection" is to prevent a train from entering an occupied block without warning.

<dt><b>Protected Signal</b> <dd>The next signal after the one you are controlling in the 
direction and route of travel. 
The "protection" is to prevent a train from approaching a stop signal 
without sufficient warning to allow it to be stopped short of reaching the "protected" signal.

<dt><b>System Name</b> <dd>The internal JMRI representation for the actual hardware being used
to control the signal. This will vary depending on your hardware, and must match your system.

</dl>

<a name="table"><h2>Signal Head Table</h2></a>

<A href="./images/SigTable.gif"><IMG SRC="./images/SigTable.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="750" HEIGHT="332" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0"></A>
<p>All the signals that JMRI knows about can be referenced
using the "Signal Head Table" tool in the Tools menu of most JMRI programs.
There are eight columns in the table:
<UL>
<LI>The system name is assigned to the signal when it's created, 
and can't be changed.
<LI>If you're interested in having your signals carry "human readable"
names, you can click in the "User Name" column and change that information
to whatever you want.
<LI>As the signal changes, for whatever reason, the current
appearance will show in the table in the "State" column.  You can also click on the
appearance button to cycle through the available appearances:
red, yellow, green, flashing red, flashing yellow, flashing green, and dark.
<LI> The "Comment" column is for your use to record any comment you may want
to help keep track of your signal heads. It is for information only.
<LI>Click the "Delete" button in a specific row to delete the signal head. 
Remember to remove any signal head icons associated with this signal head 
and all references to this signal head. Use this button with caution!
<LI>The check box in the "Lit" column lets you control whether the
signal head on the layout is lit (checked) or stays dark (unchecked).
<LI>The check box in the "Held" column shows the "held" property of the
signal, and allows you to change it.  This property is used by e.g. CTC
machine logic to say "Don't change this signal head from red, even if it 
would be safe to do so, because I want to hold a train here".
<LI>Click the "Edit" button in a row to view or change optional information
for a signal head. Notes: System name and type cannot be changed. Only one 
signal head may be edited at a time.
</UL>

<P>To define a new signal, click on the <b>Add...</b> button.  It will
prompt you for the signal type (Triple Output; Double Output; SE8c; etc), and
whatever setup information is needed for your choice.
<P> This information is saved with the configuration in an XML file, along
with control panel setup, Logix, Routes, and similar stuff.  For more information
on creating and displaying panels, including how to show signals
on your panels, please see the 
<A HREF="../../../../html/apps/PanelPro/Panels.shtml">Panels pages</a>.

<a name="intro"><h2>Introduction to SSL</h2></a>

<p>
SSL is a JMRI tool to enable the rapid setup of basic ABS style signaling. 
	For more complex operations beyond the capability of SSL refer to the section on Logix.
	The SSL user interface is designed to be user friendly to
	all users with basic familiarity with JMRI. SSL provides a means
	for setting up basic signals in an intuitive manner, without the 
	user having to be familiar with all of the logic necessary to account for the different aspects.
	

<a name="SSL">
<A NAME="logic"><h2>Simple Signal Logic</h2></a>
<A href="./images/SigAdd.gif"><IMG SRC="./images/SSLLogic.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="354" HEIGHT="364" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0" ALT="Simple Signal Logic panel figure"></a>

Much of basic ABS signaling can be boiled down to "a signal goes red when a train
can't safely enter the block it protects; it goes yellow when the block following 
the protected block can't be entered". Although that's a simplication, it can serve
as a powerful starting point for understanding signaling logic.
<P>

The Simple Signal Logic tool allows you to configure JMRI to 
use this basic ABS type of logic to set the appearance of a signal. 
Using the panel, you enter information on:
<UL>
<li><b>Signal Named</b> The signal being driven. Enter either the
user name or system name of the signal you'd like to control,
and hit return or enter.  The rest of the fields will be filled
in with any control information that's already present.
</li>
<li><b>Protects Sensor/s</b> Which sensors (occupancy detectors) cover the block
immediately past the signal. When any of these sensors show "active" the 
signal will be set to red.</li>
<li><b>Red When Turnout</b> If the block contains a turnout, 
configure the turnout name and use the selection button to choose whether you're entering
the closed or thrown leg. The signal will be set to red
whenever the turnout is set against this track.</li>
<li><b>Protects Signal</b> The next signal that the train will reach;
this signal will be set yellow if the next signal is
red.</li>  
<li><b>With Flashing Yellow</b> If the checkbox is checked, the signal will be set
flashing yellow (JMRI will alternate between dark and yellow) if the
next protected signal is yellow, thereby giving four-block signaling.</li>
<li><b>Limited Speed</b> If the checkbox is checked, this signal will be set
to yellow as the least restrictive aspect.</li>
<li><b>Is Distant Signal</b> If the checkbox is checked, this signal will be set
to the most restrictive aspect of this signal or the next protected signal.</li>
<li><b>Approach Lighting Sensor</b> The sensor that controls the lighting of this signal. Only the
actual hardware signal will go dark. Panel indicators will show the normal signal aspect. 
Leave this entry blank to always show lit.</li>
<li><b>Facing Point Turnout</b> The signal located on the single track line, 
facing a choice of two or more tracks in the direction of travel.</li>
<li><b>Trailing Point Turnout</b> The signals located on the double track line, 
facing a single track in the direction of travel.</li></ul><p>

The case of a facing point turnout which leads to two different "Protected Signals" is also covered although the above figure doesn't show it.

If a single signal head is used to control both branches, then choose "On Facing-Point
Turnout". If a different head will control each route, then simply choose "Main"
or "Diverging" leg of turnout, as required for each one.
<p>Pause your mouse over any entry or item in the SSL creation window for a brief "tooltip" help 
reminder.</p>

<p>It's clear that this won't cover complicated interlockings nor will it 
cover the speed-signaling seen on some prototypes. For those situations use a 
combination of Logix and Routes. Logix cover the conditions, and Routes control the actions
to be taken.</p>

	
<a name="start"><h2>Getting Started</h2></a>

<p>Follow the following steps to create a signal and become familiar
with how the SSL user interface works.  This example defines a "virtual" signal
head that doesn't really exist on the layout, so it can work with any kind of layout hardware.
See the page on 
<a href="../../../../html/tools/signaling/index.shtml#table">signals</a>
for information on how to set up your real signals.
</p><ol>
</li><li> Select <b>Signal Head Table</b> in the <b>Tools</b> menu.
</li><li> In the Signal Head Table window that appears, click <b>Add</b> to begin defining a new signal head.
</li><li> In the Add New Signal window that appears choose the "Virtual Signal" type.
</li><li> Enter a system name such as IH1000.
</li><li> Click <b>OK</b> to enter this head into the Signal Head Table.  
</li><li> Enter all the signal heads that you will be using for this test, using different names.
The actual name doesn't matter, they just have to be different.
<li> Now select <b>Simple Signal Logic</b> in the <b>Tools</b> menu.
</li>
<li> Fill in the various entries to match your signals requirements as 
previously shown in the <a href="#SSL">SSL</a> section.
</li><li> Click <b>Apply</b> to make this entry active.</li>
<li> Be sure to save your work.
</ol>
<p>You have just created an SSL entry to control a signal head. It's as 
simple as that. It took 
you more time to read this tutorial than to create the SSL entry.</p>
