<h1>JMRI: Entry Exit Window</h1>

The Entry Exit system allows you to assign sensors to various location on a layout panel, 
then get the system to automatically set the route up between those sensors when they both go 
active.  If a block within the path is already Occupied, then the system will try to find an 
alternative path.
<p>
From this window you can create and delete Entry Exit Pairs for a given layout panel
<p>
You first need to assign sensors at Block boundaries on the layout editor, by using the pop up window
on block boundaries, the popup menu on turnouts or Level Crossings.
<p>
From the Entry Exit window, select the layout panel that you are working on, you can then either 
manually select the source and destination sensor pair, or all the system to automatically discover 
all the valid paths, by pressing the "Auto Generate Entry Exit Pairs" button.
<p>
The result will be populated in the table below the button.
<p>
The auto discovery will only discover fully valid pairs for sensors that are effectively protecting
 blocks that are in the same direction.  This also means that to set the route through you must first 
 set the "From" sensor then set the "To" sensor, if you want to be able to set the route by selecting 
 either sensor first, then you will need to check the "Both Way" option.  If the end point is assigned 
 an end Bumper then this will not be possible.
<p>
It is possible to manually add Entry Exit pairs for sensors that are in effect protecting blocks that 
work in opposite directions.  Here you will need to use the drop down options to select the start and 
finish locations against a layout panel.  Again you can select this pair to be "Both Way" working.
