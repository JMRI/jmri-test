<H1>JMRI: Setting The JMRI Preferences</H1>

This help screen opens automatically when the JMRI preferences
have not been set, or there was a preferences-related error while
the program was starting up.  It walks you through setting the
preferences for basic operation.

<p>
Once the preferences are set properly, this screen won't display
any more.  You can get back to the
<a href="">main preferences help page</a>
by selecting "Window Help" in the Help menu of the preferences window.

<p>
There's also more information on setting preferences
on the 
<a href="../../manual/Getting_Started.shtml#Preferences">tutorial pages</a>.

<h2>Basic Preferences</h2>
<p>
The first thing to do is set the basic preferences.

<dl>
<dt>Layout Connection
<dd>You can select any of the various JMRI layout connections here.
For more information on how to configure this for your particular hardware,
see the <a href="../../html/hardware/index.shtml">hardware pages</a>.
<dt>GUI Style
<dd>These radio boxes allow you to select how the program looks.
The available choices depend on what kind of computer you have, and not 
all of the following may be available:
    <ul>
    <li>Metal - the default Java style, usable on all computers
    <li>CDE/Motif - A Linux/Unix form that works well with X Windows
        screen managers.  It's also available on (almost) all computer types.
    <li>Windows - only available on Microsoft Windows systems, this makes the
        program look as much as possible like a regular Windows application.
    <li>Mac OS X - only available on MacOS, this makes the program look
        like a Macintosh application
    </ul>
<dt>Programmer Defaults
<dd>The DecoderPro programmer allows you to select how much or how little
to display of the decoder content using configurable "Programmers". You 
can select one at the same time you 
<a href="../../manual/Basic_Programming.shtml">select your locomotive decoder</a>,
but this provides a convenient place to set a default so you don't
have to select it each time you open a decoder.
</dl>

Perhaps the most important control is at the bottom of this section:
The "Save" button!  
<p>
Be sure to click "Save" when leaving this window.  Your changes to the preferences
don't take effect until the program is stopped and restarted, so the
program will prompt you to do that after saving the preferences.

<h2>Advanced Preferences</h2>

The "Show Advanced Preferences" checkbox allows you to
customize your connection to the layout. You do not need to use the
advanced preferences to
get your initial connection to the layout up and running, and it is
recommended that you leave them alone until the connection to your
command station is working properly. 
<p>
For more information on setting the advanced preferences, 
see the 
<a href="AppConfigPanel.shtml#advanced">Advanced Preferences help section</a>.
