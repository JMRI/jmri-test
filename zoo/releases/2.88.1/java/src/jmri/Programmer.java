/**
 * Provide access to the hardware DCC decoder programming capability.
 * <P>
 * Programmers come in multiple types:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>Global, previously Service Mode, e.g. on a programming track
 * <LI>Addressed, previously Ops Mode, e.g. "programming on the main"
 * </UL>
 * Different equipment may also require different programmers:
 * <LI>DCC CV programming, on service mode track or on the main
 * <LI>CBUS Node Variable programmers
 * <LI>LocoNet System Variable programmers
 * <LI>LocoNet Op Switch programmers
 * </UL>
 * Depending on which type you have, only certain modes can
 * be set. Valid modes are specified by the class static constants.
 * <P>
 * You get a Programmer object from a {@link ProgrammerManager},
 * which in turn can be located from the {@link InstanceManager}.
