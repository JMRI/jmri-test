The JMRI 2.7.4 test version is now available for download. 

This is the specific version for Linux users. 

It contains many new features, including:

* Improved support for the ECoS command station
* A much better method of storing panel files so they can be moved 
  from one computer to another (but see warning below!)
* Improvements to Signal Head editing, Logix and Conditionals

along with other changes.
