Making an update distribution:

( ) Copy and rename the last update distribution

( ) update the JMRI.0.9.2.update.README to include 
    any changes, esp. including updating the release name and URLs. 

( ) apps.DecoderPro.DecoderPro needs to have the version number updated.

( ) Commit all cvs source and tag "Release-9-2"

( ) Rebuild, make the jmri.jar file 

( ) Move the jmri.jar file to the distribution folder

( ) Remove the .DS_Store, .FBCIndex, .FBCLockFolder files in the distribution

( ) Update the xml subdirectory, removing the CVS subdirs

( ) Create the JMRI.0.9.2.update.zip file with DropZip

( ) Make an opt-copy of the folder to the desktop, then install into 
    a copy of the previous distribution and test
    
( ) Test .zip as update under Windows, under OS 9

( ) Move to distribution site via SourceForge release:

	ftp upload.sourceforge.net 
		user: ftp 
		password: me@myself.org 
		cd incoming 
		bin 
		put JMRI.M.N.zip
		put JMRI.M.N.tar.gz
		put JMRI.M.N.hqx
		
	Login to SourceForge web 
	Go to the project home page, then admin page
	Click on Edit/Release Files  & release the file in the DecoderPro category.
	(After the next main release, this should move to JMRI category)
		
	The release name convention is "Update 0.9.2 for DecoderPro, JMRI"
	
	Be sure to select "preserve preformatted text"

( ) Update CVS copy

    cd cvs
    cvs -d cvs.jmri.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri update -d -r Release-App-M-N
    
( ) Wait for the files to appear in the upload area

( ) News item from JMRI sourceforge page

	Title is of the form "JMRI, DecoderPro update 0.9.2 is available"

( ) mail announcement to jmri-announce@lists.sourceforge.net

( ) Decide if worth announcing elsewhere:

		loconet_hackers@yahoogroups.com
		digitrax@yahoogroups.com
		2 NCE groups
		
( ) Take a break!
