# Sample script to show a JFrame for data entry.
# The frame contains two JTextFields, and a button
# which is inactive until data has been entered.  Once 
# activated, the button prints a little diagnostic
# message when clicked.  The print statement can be 
# changed to include whatever desired, e.g. throw a turnout,
# program a CV, etc.
