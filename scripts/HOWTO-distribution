This is the HOWTO file to make a complete SourceForge downloadable
distribution.  ($Revision: 1.28 $)

Start with a directory, typically called "Distributions", that
contains:

  scripts
  ln -s scripts/build.xml build.xml

  Linux
  	JMRI (the most recent distribution)
  MacClassic
  	JMRI (the most recent distribution)
  MacOSX
  	JMRI (the most recent distribution)
  OS2
  	JMRI (the most recent distribution)

  (Windows is separate, and involves a shared disk with VPC, but
   basically all the necessary stuff is in a VPC directory)
   
This probably already exists. Make sure that scripts, etc, have
been updated!

Make sure everything is up-to-date:

( ) Remake the help index  (need a command line approach, so can put in ant!)
    cd JMRI/jhelp/help/en
    (launch JHelpDev, e.g. "open jhelpdev.jar")
    (navigate to JHelpDev.xml & open it)
    
( ) To ensure that you've got the HEAD of CVS, in your test area do:

    cvs -q update -d help jython lib resources xml
    cd java
    cvs -q update -d build.xml jmri.jpx JMRILibraries.library lib manifest src test

    
    cd Distributions/scripts
    cvs -q update -d
    
    
To actually create the distribution:

( ) Go to your working directory and
	cvs tag Release-1-2-3 src test build.xml jmri.jpx JMRILibraries.library manifest
	cd ..
	cvs tag Release-1-2-3 help jython resources xml
	
	cd lib
	cvs tag Release-1-2-3 collections.jar comm.jar crimson.jar jdom-jdk11.jar jh.jar log4j.jar security.policy
	
	The following two tags are needed for the build & test process:
	cvs tag Release-1-2-3 Serialio.jar junit.jar

( ) Come back to Distributions and 
    cd scripts
    cvs update
	(be sure that's the default.lcf you want!)
	cvs tag Release-1-2-3
    cd ..
    
	ant -Drelease=Release-1-2-3 -Dnumber=1.2.3 release1
	
	Ensure tests pass!
	
	Check DecoderPro for no startup errors, right version

	Ant will launch three StuffIt processes; click
	each to proceed, and wait for them to be running.
	
( ) Once they launch, you can start building the Windows installer
	in parallel.
	
	Launch Installer Vise from the last build file.
	"Update archive"; Check changes make sense.
	Click the "test archive" button (right one of the pair)
	After the installer runs, run DecoderPro from desktop icon and check.
	In IV, "Save as..." the VCT file as the new name
	Drag-copy .exe to Mac, copy to final Distributions; name should be OK

( ) Once the three StuffIt processes are done
	ant -Drelease=Release-1-2-3 -Dnumber=1.2.3 release2
	
	This will launch one more StuffIt process (for MacClassic)
	Wait for it to complete.
	
( ) Once the 4th StuffIt process is done, start uploading via
	ant -Drelease=Release-1-2-3 -Dnumber=1.2.3 release3

( ) Create and upload the XSLT pages. This can be done at any time,
    but doing it now works well in parallel
    
    cd ../xml/XLST
    ant xslt
    ant upload

( ) The Windows .exe must be present before the next step
	
( ) When ready to upload the Windows version:
	ant -Drelease=Release-1-2-3 -Dnumber=1.2.3 release4
	
    This also creates and uploads the JavaDocs as a last step
		
( ) Format the email announcement; you'll cut and paste parts
	to the release form.

( ) Login to SourceForge web 
	Go to the project home page, then admin page
	Click on Edit/Release Files  & release each of the three files
	in the order:
	
		OS/2
		Macintosh classic
		Linux
		MacOS X
		Windows
		
	Be sure to update the top of the release note paragraph.
	
	The test release name convention is "Test version 1.2.3 for Linux"
	
	Be sure to select "preserve preformatted text"

( ) mail announcement to jmriusers@yahoogroups.com

( ) For a production version, update web page source:
    	Linux install.html         
    	MacOS Classic install.html 
    	MacOS X install.html       
    	OS2 install.html          
    	Windows install.html
		index.html
		DecoderPro/index.html
		README.html
		
( ) commit site and update on server
	
( ) News item from JMRI sourceforge page

	Title is of the form "JMRI M.N is available"

( ) mail announcement to jmri-announce@lists.sourceforge.net

( ) Decide if worth announcing elsewhere:
		MAC_DCC@yahoogroups.com
		loconet_hackers@yahoogroups.com
		digitrax@yahoogroups.com
		2 NCE groups
		
( ) Take a break!
