Making a distribution (substitute the release-name for 0.6 throughout):

( ) Copy and rename the last distribution

( ) update the README to include any changes, esp. including updating
	the release name and URLs

( ) Any new jar files that need to be put in the lib area?

( ) Make sure that the "make manifest" button is pushed, then
	make the jmri.jar file with the JMRI demo release target.

( ) Commit and tag "release-0-6"

( ) Move the jmri.jar file to the distribution folder

( ) Update the various text files from the CVS scripts module. 

( ) Update the xml subdirectory, removing the CVS subdirs

( ) Upload folder to jmri.sourceforge.net via NiftyTelnet/SSH

( ) Remove the Macintosh App and certain jar files:

    cd JMRI.demo.0.6
    rm JMRI\ demo
    rm lib/javax.comm.MRJ.jar
 	rm lib/swingall.jar
	
   At this point, lib should contain:
     collections.jar  jdom-jdk11.jar  log4j.jar  xerces.jar
   
( ) Update permissions

    chmod 755 JmriDemo.tcsh
    
( ) Make a zip file

    cd ..
    # now above the distribution directory
    
    zip -rl JMRI.demo.0.7.zip JMRI.demo.0.7
	zip JMRI.demo.0.7A.zip JMRI.demo.0.7/jmri.jar JMRI.demo.0.7/lib/*.jar
	
	# the first line adds CR's, and the second replaces the .jar files so they
	# don't have CR inserted
	
( ) Make a .tar.gz

	tar cf JMRI.demo.0.6.tar JMRI.demo.0.6
	gzip JMRI.demo.0.6.tar
	
( ) Back on the Mac, start MRJAppBuilder.
		Properties:  Release properties
		Output file:  JMRI demo (in your target location; overwrite existing)
		Merge files:  jmri.jar
    And then make the output
	   
( ) Copy the application file to the release (if you didn't create it there)
	   and update its icon. 
	   
( ) Make an opt-copy of the folder to the desktop, then into a CD.

( ) Test it on the test machine!

( ) Drag folder onto DropStuff, which will create a file JMRI.demo.0.6.hqx
	(Preferences should be set for Macintosh, include linefeeds, remote .sit
	suffix)

( ) Upload Mac distribution to sourceforge home via SSH

( ) Move to distribution site via SourceForge release:

	ftp upload.sourceforge.net 
		user: ftp 
		password: me@myself.org 
		cd incoming 
		bin 
		put JMRI.demo.0.6.zip
		put JMRI.demo.0.6.tar.gz
		put JMRI.demo.0.6.hqx
		
	Login to SourceForge web 
	Go to the project home page, then admin page
	Click on Edit/Release Files 
	
	Be sure to select "preserve preformatted text"

( ) Update web pages:
	site/index.html - download links, demo release name
	site/InstallJMRI.html - download instructions
	site/demoFiles/README.html - new README contents
	
( ) commit site and update on server
	
( ) Update CVS

    cd cvs
    cvs -d cvs.jmri.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri update -r Release-0-7
    
( ) Create a snapshot in zip format

	cd
	zip -rl snapshot-release-0-7.zip cvs
	
	(l option modified newlines to cr-lf)
	
( ) Create JavaDoc
	Ensure that CW JMRI debug target has JavaDoc selected as prelinker
	Build JMRI debug target

( ) Upload JavaDoc

	Upload the Development Project:Docs folder to htdocs/Technical/

( ) News item

( ) mail announcement
