This is the HOWTO file to make a complete SourceForge downloadable
distribution.

Start with a directory, typically called "Distributions", that
contains:

  Linux
  	JMRI (the most recent distribution)
  MacClassic
  	JMRI (the most recent distribution)
  MacOSX
  	JMRI (the most recent distribution)
  OS2
  	JMRI (the most recent distribution)

(Windows is separate)
   scripts
   ln -s scripts/build.xml build.xml
   
This probably already exists....

( ) Go to your working directory and
	cvs tag Release-1-2-3 src test jmri.jpx build.xml

( ) Come back to Distributions and 
	ant -Drelease=Release-1-2-4 -Dnumber=1.2.4 release1

	This will launch three StuffIt processes; click
	each to proceed, and wait for them to complete.
	
	In the meantime, you can start building the Window installer

( ) Once the three StuffIt processes are done
	ant -Drelease=Release-1-2-4 -Dnumber=1.2.4 release2
	
	This will launch one more (for MacClassic)
	Wait for it to complete.
	
	Also, copy in the .exe for windows, with the complete name
	
( ) Once the three StuffIt processes are done
	ant -Drelease=Release-1-2-4 -Dnumber=1.2.4 release3

( ) When ready to upload:
	ant -Drelease=Release-1-2-4 -Dnumber=1.2.4 release4


	

		
( ) Login to SourceForge web 
	Go to the project home page, then admin page
	Click on Edit/Release Files  & release each of the three files
	in the order:
	
		linux
		OS/2
		macintosh classic
		MacOS X
		Windows
		
	Be sure to update the top of the release note paragraph.
	
	The release name convention is "JMRI M.N (demo | development release) for XXX"
	
	Be sure to select "preserve preformatted text"

( ) If this is a production release, create & upload a source .zip

( ) mail announcement to jmriusers@yahoogroups.com

( ) For a production version, update web page source:
    	Linux install.html         
    	MacOS Classic install.html 
    	MacOS X install.html       
    	OS2 install.html          
    	Windows install.html
		index.html
		DecoderPro/index.html
		README.html
		
( ) commit site and update on server
	
( ) News item from JMRI sourceforge page

	Title is of the form "JMRI M.N is available"

( ) mail announcement to jmri-announce@lists.sourceforge.net

( ) Decide if worth announcing elsewhere:
		MAC_DCC@yahoogroups.com
		loconet_hackers@yahoogroups.com
		digitrax@yahoogroups.com
		2 NCE groups
		
( ) Take a break!
