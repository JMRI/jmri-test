<h1> 
JMRI: Signal Groups Table
</h1>
		<p>The Signal Groups Table displays a list of your Signal Mast Groups.</p>
		<p>There are six columns in the Signal Groups Table:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Each line starts with the System Name and User Name of each Signal Group</li>
			<li>You may add a Comment by double clicking on that field</li>
			<li>The following column contains a "Delete" button for that Signal Group</li>
				<li>By unchecking the "Enabled" check box you can disable a particular Signal Mast Group temporarily</li>
				<li>Finally there is an "Edit" button</li>
		</ul>

		<a name="add"><h3>Creating a Signal Group</h3></a>
<p>To define a new Signal Group, click on the <a href="SignalGroupAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a> button at the bottom of the Signal Groups Table. This will prompt you for a Signal Group name and whatever further information is needed.
<p>You can delete a Signal Group from the Signal Groups Table by clicking the "Delete"" button. Save
a copy of your JMRI Configuration file as a backup first!

<a name="edit"><h3>Editing an Existing Signal Group</h3>
	<p> Click on the <b>Edit</b> button at the right of the Signal Groups Table to open the <a href="SignalGroupAddEdit.shtml">Edit Signal Group</a> window.

<h2>Junction Indicators</h2>
<p>A Junction indicator can be configured to display anything from 1 to 6 diverging routes.  A single indicator will frequently be found where a branch line diverges off from a main line.  Multiple indicators will be found in more complex areas such as the approach to stations and good yards, where multiple routes can be taken.  The junction indicator informs the driver that he is about to take a different route and should therefore adjust his speed according to the signage.<br>
The Junction indicators themselves will be set according to a given set of Turnouts for that junction.

<h2>Route Indicators</h2>
<p>A route indicator as used in the UK, will display a number or letter, they are predominately found attached to signals on the approach to a Station.  They display which platform the train has been routed into, given the complexity of some station throats, there may be a number of different physical routes that could be take from the signal to the destination. Thus a junction indicator could not be used when tided in with turnout positions. In addition the junction indicator can only deal with 6 different routes, and some stations have more than 6 platforms.<br>
Therefore, the route indicator can only display one destination at time. The displaying of a route doesn't necessarily indicate that the driver will take the same route to get to the destination platform.
