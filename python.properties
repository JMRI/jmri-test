# Python Interpreter Properties
#
# JMRI searches for a python.properties file in the User Files
# directory, the Settings directory, and the installation directory in order,
# and uses the first python.properties file found. It is recommended that users
# copy the python.properties file from the installation directory into the
# User Files or Settings directory instead of editing python.properties in the
# installation directory.

# Augment the default search path for module files. The format is the same as
# the shellâ€™s PATH: one or more directory pathnames separated by os.pathsep
# (e.g. colons on Unix or semicolons on Windows). Non-existent directories are
# silently ignored.
# In addition to normal directories, individual python.path entries may refer to
# zipfiles containing pure Python modules (in either source or compiled form).
# Extension modules cannot be imported from zipfiles.
#python.path=

# Prevent Python from scanning the classpath for Java packages if true.
# Although this speeds up initialization of the Python interpreter, it prevents
# the importing of packaging into a Python script.
# The default is false
#python.cachedir.skip=true
