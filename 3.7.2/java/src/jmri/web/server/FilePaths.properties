# FilePaths.properties
#
# Map URI request base path to path on local directory structure.
# Local directory paths use portable pathnames as described in
# jmri.util.FileUtil.getExternalFilename()
#
# URI base paths with absolute pathnames are used to redirect paths to other
# servlets (this mechanism is used to maintain backwards compatibility with
# older path mappings or HTML applications)
#
# Mapping to associate a path with a servlet, FileHandler, or RedirectHandler
# is in jmri.web.server.Services.properties
