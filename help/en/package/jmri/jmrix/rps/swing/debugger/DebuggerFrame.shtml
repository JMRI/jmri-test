The debugger window lets you look at information as it moves
through the RPS system.

<p>
The upper left part displays the time value from each active receiver
every time a reading is taken. 

<p>
If a position was successfully computed from
a set of times, the "residual" value is displayed for each receiver.
This is the difference between the measured time and the time that
the RPS system expected to measure if the locomotive was really in that position.
Typical value are up to about plus or minus 100, corresponding to about a inch in accuracy.
If one or two receivers have much larger residual values, there
may be a problem with the readings from that receiver with the transmitter 
in its current location.

<p>
The bottom section of the window shows the position calculated from each reading.

<p>
It's also possible to type values into the fields and ask the system to process them as
if they were inputs.  The selection box and button at the bottom are how you do this.
