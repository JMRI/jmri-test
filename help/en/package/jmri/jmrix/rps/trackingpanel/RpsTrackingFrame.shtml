<h2> 
JMRI: RPS Tracking Frame
</h2>

This frame displays a map of there RPS measurements are located.
As each position reading comes in, a line is drawn to the new position
from the last position.
<P>
In the top part of the window are some simple controls.
<p>
Normally, measurements flagged as in error are just skipped. They often carry
very large position values, and will result in lines running off the panel.
If you do want to see them, check the "show errors" checkbox.

<p>
The four text boxes and "set" button let you set the coordinate mapping
for the window.  The top two set the RPS position that corresponds to the upper-right
corner of the display frame, while the lower two set the RPS position that corresponds to
the lower left corner.  The lower-left corner is often set to 0,0, and the upper left
set to large enough values to show your entire layout, but you don't have to do it like that.

<p>
If you resize the window, the display is erased and starts over.
