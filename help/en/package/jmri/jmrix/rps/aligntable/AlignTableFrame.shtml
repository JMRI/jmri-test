The RPS Receiver Control window lets you update and examine
the RPS system's information about where its receivers are located.

<p>
Usually the RPS system will detect how many receivers it has
and set up the table with the right number of rows.
You can change that by changing the number of receivers in the
text bus and clicking "Set". 
<p>
Once you have the right number of receivers defined, enter
each one's
X, Y and Z coordinates in the table.

<p>
By default, the RPS system measures position in inches.
If you'd prefer to use some other unit, such as meters or feet,
you change the number used for the speed of sound.
Typical values are:
<dl>
<dt>Inches<dd>0.01345
<dt>Feet<dd>0.001
<dt>Meters<dd>0.0003
<dt>cm<dd>0.03
</dl>
If you change this value, be sure to click the "Set" box.

<p>
The "offset" value should usually be left unchanged.

<p>
To save the values as the new defaults, which will be used
the next time the program is started, click the "Set Defaults" button.
<p>
To save the values in a separate file, click "Store...", then select
where you want to put the file and what you want to call it.
<p>
To load values from a previously stored file, click "Load..." and 
select the file.
