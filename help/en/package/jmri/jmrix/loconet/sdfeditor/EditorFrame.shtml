<H2>SDF Sound File Editor
</H2>
    
Digitrax sound decoders are loaded with "sound projects", stored in
"Sound Project" (.spj) files.  Those contain a number of "sound fragments"
in .wav format, plus a small program that tells the decoder when to 
play the various sounds, and controls the use of functions and CVs.  That
program is stored in a "Sound Definition" (SDF) format.

<p>
The SDF Sound File Editor allows you to make certain kinds of changes
to the SDF information in a sound project.  It's used with the 
<a href="../soundloader/EditorFrame.shtml">SPJ editor</a>
because the SDF information is stored in a Digitrax SPJ sound project file. 
After you edit the SDF information, you can save it to a file
from the 
<a href="../soundloader/EditorFrame.shtml">SPJ editor</a>,
and the download it to a Digitrax sound decoder with a Digitrax PR2 and the 
<a href="../soundloader/LoaderFrame.shtml">JMRI sound downloader tool</a>
or the Digitrax SoundLoader program.

<p>
Digitrax provides sample sound project files at their Sound Depot 
<a href="http://www.digitrax.com/sounddepot.php">(http://www.digitrax.com/sounddepot.php)</a>
web site. You can also find links to documentation and additional tools there.

<p>
When you open the SDF editor by clicking the "Edit" button
in the 
<a href="../soundloader/EditorFrame.shtml">SPJ editor</a>,
a new window opens that has two parts:<br/>
<a href="SdfInitSound.gif">
<img src="SdfInitSound.gif" width="415" height="235" alt="SDF Editor"/></a><br/>
On the left is a
view of the entire SDF information as a tree of
nested elements. On the right is a window
that shows additional information on 
the element that's selected on the left.

<p>
The right hand window has the "assembly" format for the
selected element at the top, then an explanation of what
the element does in the middle.  If an editor for that 
particular type of element has been defined, the section at the
bottom will have checkboxes and selection boxes for modifying the
content of the element.

<h3>Status and Future Work</h3>

This editor tool is still very much a work in progress.
It's good at browsing the content of the file, but it needs
a lot more explanatory text added.
Also, it currently only provides a way to make small changes to the 
contents of an SDF file, but doesn't (yet)
allow you to make larger changes to structure of the file.
For example, if you
selected an "Initiate Sound" element, which tells the decoder
to start playing a sound under certain conditions, you
can change those conditions.  But the editor (at present)
doesn't provide a way to add new "Initiate Sound" elements.

<p>
The editor is meant to be a beginner's tool, and we need a 
lot of explanatory text on each window so people know what the
options do.
