JMRI provides a communications monitor window so you can see what's happening
on the communications link between the program and the layout CBUS.

<p>
Once you open a monitor window, it will automatically
display all traffic on the link.

<h2>Logging To A File</h2>

Sometimes, it's helpful to capture what's happening. For example,
you might encounter a bug (!!), and want to send a copy of what's 
happening to the people who are trying to fix it.
<p>
Small amounts of data can be copied from the log window with 
your computers "copy" command (e.g. ctrl-C or cmd-C), and then
pasted into an email.
<p>
If you want to capture more, you can have the window write a 
log file on your computer's disk.  To do this:
<ol>
<li>Click "Choose log file".  A file-chooser window
will open.  Navigate to where you want to store the file,
enter a name for the new log file, and click "Save". Note that
if you pick a file that already exists, it will be overwritten.
<li>When you're ready to capture the data you want, click
"Start logging" on the monitor window.
<li>When you're done, click "Stop logging" to store the data
and close the file.
</ol>

<h2>Controls</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Clear Screen</dt>
  <dd>Erases the log area at the top of the screen
  </dd>
<dt>Freeze Screen</dt>
  <dd>Stops acquiring new information, so that the captured information stops scrolling up
  </dd>
<dt>Show raw data</dt>
  <dd>Normally, the monitor displays the program's interpretation of what it's seeing.
  If you want to see the raw bytes, check this box.
  </dd>
<dt>Show timestamps</dt>
  <dd>Normally, the program just displays the data from the communication link.
  If you'd like each message to be preceeded by the time it was sent or
  received, check this box.
