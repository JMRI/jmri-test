<H1>Show NCE Cabs</H1>
<P>
	This tool provides a list of the NCE cabs connected to your NCE command station.
	Up to 63 cabs can be connected, the type of cabs are ProCab, Cab04, USB, and AIU.
	The tool also provides each cab's active locomotive address, speed, consist number,
	and which locomotive functions are active.
</P>
<P>
	The monitor will read the current cab information when the tool is first selected.
	It will then update the list when the "Refresh" button is pressed or if a cab address
	is purged.
<P>
	To help manage cabs on very large layouts the display will show the last time a cab
	was seen as active and changed settings.
	Using that you can then enter the cab id and use the "Purge" button to mark
	the cab address as in-active.
	This is expected to improve the keystroke response on the remaining cabs
	as the command station will not have to timeout waiting for a response from
	the purged cab address.
</P>
