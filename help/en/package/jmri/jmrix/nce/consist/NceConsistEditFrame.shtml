<H2>Edit NCE Consist</H2>
This tool allows you to review, edit, and save NCE style consists. It
also allows you to backup and restore all the NCE command station
consists to and from a file. The file format is identical to NCE, so you
can restore a file that was generated by the NCE backup command. Very
useful since the restore and backup commands in the 2007 EPROM don't
currently work! We recommend that you set the baud rate at 9600 when
using this tool.
<H3>Backup</H3>

To backup all of your consists to a file, press the "Backup" button
located on the bottom row of the JMRI consist editor. A default file
name will appear in the Save window, you can change the name it to
whatever you wish. Press the "Save" button and the JMRI consist editor
will read the NCE command station memory and store the contents into the
file you selected.

<H3>Restore</H3>

To restore all of your consists from a file, press the "Restore" button
located on the bottom row of the JMRI consist editor. Select a file by
typing the name, or clicking on it. Press the "Open" button and the JMRI
consist editor will write the NCE command station memory with the
contents of the file you selected. The JMRI consist editor will check
the contents of the file before writing the command station memory to
verify that the file is indeed a NCE consist backup file! Note that the
"Restore" only updates the NCE command station memory. It doesn't program
the engines on your layout.

<H3>Get</H3>

To review a consist, enter the number of the consist in the text box
under the heading "Consist" and press the "Get" button. This will
retrieve the consist from the command station's memory.


<H3>Add Engine</H3>

To add an engine to a consist, enter the engine's address and then press
the "??" button until the desired direction "Forward" or "Reverse"
appears. If you want the use the short address format press the "Long"
button and "Short" should appear. To program the engine with the consist
address and update the NCE command station, press the "Add" button and
the engine will be added to the consist.

<H3>Replace</H3>

To replace the lead or rear engine, press the "Replace" button. This
will delete the selected engine from the consist. Enter the address of the new
engine along with its direction and press "Add" to program this engine
with the consist address. If you want a mid engine to now be a lead or
rear engine, just enter the mid engine's address and then press "Add".

<H3>Delete</H3>

To delete an engine from the consist, press the "Delete" button across
from the engine address you wish to remove.

<H3>Clear</H3>

To remove all engines from a consist, press the "Clear" button located
on the bottom row.


<H3>Previous and Next</H3>
The "Previous" and "Next" buttons allow you to search for consists. If
you're looking for an empty consist, click the "Empty Consist" box
located in the upper right hand corner.
