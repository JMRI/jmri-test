<p>
JMRI needs to know how a signal head on the layout
is connected to the electrical hardware.  Once it knows that,
it can send the right commands to control the appearance of the
signal head.
<p>
The "Add Signal Head" dialog gives you a number of different 
choices for how the signal head is connected:
<dl>
<dt>Triple Output</dt>
  <dd>
  This type controls a signal head via three electrical connections.
  One goes to a green lamp/LED, one to a yellow one, 
  and the third to a red one.
  <p>
  These connections are controlled via the JMRI Turnout
  logic, and therefore appear in the Turnout Table.
  They're not really connected to switch motors, though,
  they're just electrical outputs.
  <p>
  For each connection, enter the appropriate JMRI
  turnout for the electrical connection on the layout,
  either as a number (1,2,3) or as a JMRI
  name (system name like LT1, CT2 or an already-defined user name). 
  They need not be consecutive or in any particular order.
  <p>
  If you need to debug one of these signal heads, start by
  checking whether the Turnout connections work. You can
  do this by going to the 
  <a href="TurnoutTable.shtml">Turnout Table</a> and changing the output setting
  there.
  Setting e.g.
  the turnout on the "green" connection Thrown should light the
  green lamp.
  </dd>

<dt>Double Output</dt>
  <dd>
  This type controls a signal head via two electrical connections.
  One goes to a green lamp/LED, and the other to a red one.
  Yellow is created by turning them both on at the same time.
  <p>
  These connections are controlled via the JMRI Turnout
  logic, and therefore appear in the Turnout Table.
  They're not really connected to switch motors, though,
  they're just electrical outputs.
  <p>
  For each connection, enter the appropriate JMRI
  turnout for the electrical connection on the layout, 
  either as a number (1,2) or as a JMRI
  name (system name like LT1, CT2 or an already-defined user name). 
  They need not be consecutive or in any particular order.
  <p>
  If you need to debug one of these signal heads, start by
  checking whether the Turnout connections work. You can
  do this by going to the 
  <a href="TurnoutTable.shtml">Turnout Table</a> and changing the output setting
  there.
  Setting e.g.
  the turnout on the "green" connection Thrown should light the
  green lamp.
  </dd>

<dt>Virtual</dt>
  <dd>
  This type doesn't connect to the layout at all.
  Use it when you want to e.g. display a signal on a PanelPro panel,
  but don't have a real one on the layout.
  </dd>

<dt>SE8c 4 Aspect</dt>
  <dd>
  This type controls signal heads attached to a 
  <a href="http://www.digitrax.com">Digitrax</a>
  <a href="http://www.digitrax.com/prd_statdec_se8c.php">SE8c signal driver card</a>.
  <p>
  In the text field, enter the appropriate address as a number.  For example,
  the 1st signal head on the 1st SE8c, as configured from the Digitrax
  factory, is addressed by putting a "257" here. See e.g. page
  5 of the Digitrax SE8c manual 
  (<a href="http://www.digitrax.com/ftp/se8c.pdf">http://www.digitrax.com/ftp/se8c.pdf</a>).
  </dd>

<dt>LDT LS-DEC</dt>
  <dd>
  This type is particularly useful for European signaling.
  It controls signal heads attached to a
  <a href="http://www.ldt-infocenter.com/english/home_frame_e.htm">Littfinski DatenTechnik (LDT)</a>
  <A href="http://www.ldt-infocenter.com/english/lsdec_sb_e.htm">LS-DEC signal decoder</a>,
  or a 
  <A HREF="http://www.marathonmodel.cz/">Marathon Model</a>
  DP2N decoder.
  <p>
  These controllers use seven DCC turnout (accessory decoder) addresses to specify
  the seven possible appearances of the signal.  Enter those, either as 
  numbers (1,2,3,...) or as JMRI turnout 
  names (system names like LT1, CT2 and/or already-defined user names),
  in the appropriate text fields.
  <p>
  For more information on configuring these signals, see
  the 
  <a href="../../../../html/tools/signaling/ldt/output.shtml">examples page</a>.
  </dd>
  
<dt>DCC Signal Decoder</dt>
  <dd>
  This type controls signal heads attached to a 
  decoder that uses the 
  <a href="http://www.nmra.org/standards/DCC/standards_rps/rp921.html#Extended%20Accessory%20Decoder%20Control%20Packet%20Format">DCC signal packets</a>
  defined by the 
  <a href="http://www.nmra.org/standards/DCC/DCCHome.html">NMRA DCC Working Group</a>.
  <p>
  Enter the DCC address as a number.
  </dd>

<dt>Grapevine</dt>
  <dd>
  This type controls signal heads attached to a
  <a href="http://www.protrak.cc/">ProTrak</a>
  <A href="http://www.protrak.cc/signals.htm">Grapevine node</a>.
  <p>
  In the text field, enter a system name for a Grapevine
  signal head, e.g. GH1204 for the 4th connector on the 2nd bank connector of the 1st node.
  For more information on how those names are generated, see the 
  <a href="../../../../html/hardware/grapevine/Names.shtml">page on Grapevine names</a>.
  </dd>

<dt>Quadruple Output</dt>
  <dd>
  This type controls a signal head via four electrical connections.
  One goes to a green lamp/LED, one to a yellow one, 
  one to a red one, and the fourth to a "lunar" (white) one.
  <p>
  These connections are controlled via the JMRI Turnout
  logic, and therefore appear in the Turnout Table.
  They're not really connected to switch motors, though,
  they're just electrical outputs.
  <p>
  For each connection, enter the appropriate JMRI
  turnout for the electrical connection on the layout,
  either as a number (1,2,3) or as a JMRI
  name (system name like LT1, CT2 or an already-defined user name). 
  They need not be consecutive or in any particular order.
  <p>
  If you need to debug one of these signal heads, start by
  checking whether the Turnout connections work. You can
  do this by going to the 
  <a href="TurnoutTable.shtml">Turnout Table</a> and changing the output setting
  there.
  Setting e.g.
  the turnout on the "green" connection Thrown should light the
  green lamp.
  </dd>

</dl>
The "Edit Signal Head" dialog (window) provides for viewing and changing optional 
information for existing signal heads. Use the "Edit" buttons in the 
Signal Head Table to select a signal head. Signal type and system name may not be 
changed. After making changes in the dialog, click "Update" to change signal 
head information.  Click "Cancel" to exit without
making any changes. Closing the Edit Signal Head window is equivalent to clicking 
"Cancel". Only one signal head may be edited at a time.
