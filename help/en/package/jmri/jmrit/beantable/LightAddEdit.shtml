<H2>Adding/Editing Lights</H2>
    
<A ID="addLight"><H3>Adding a new Light</H3></a>
To add a new Light, follow this procedure:
<ol>
	<li><p>Click <b>Light Table</b> in the <b>Tools</b> menu to bring up
the Light Table, and click the <b>Add...</b> button at the bottom of the 
table to bring up the Add/Edit Light window.</p>
	<li><p>Enter a system name, according to the JMRI convention. The first
letter designates your hardware system ('L' for loconet, 'C" for C/MRI,
etc.), and the second letter must be 'L' for Light. These are followed by
a number that gives the hardware address of the digital output bit being
referenced.  Examples of valid system addresses are: CL1004, and LL401, 
assuming you have the hardware for the addressed digital output bits.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Enter a user name. Any string of characters that is different 
from the user name of other Lights will be accepted, but it's 
wise to use a string that describes the intended use of the Light.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Select the control type from the options in the popup menu.  
When you change the control type, different options appear on the two lines
below. Control options are discussed in more detail 
<A HREF="#lightcontrol">below</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Enter the required information to complete the control definition 
in the fields that appear. If you need to enter a sensor name or a turnout 
name, you must enter the name (system name or user name) of an existing 
sensor or turnout. <b>Caution</b>: if you enter a user name, be careful about 
changing the user name of your sensor or turnout. A simple change
of user name could break your Light control definition.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Next is the notes area of the Add/Edit Light window.  This is 
where instructions and error messages will appear as you create or edit 
a Light. Always check this area to see if things went as expected.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Click the <b>Create</b> button at the bottom of the window.  
If everything is fine, a message stating "New Light added ... " will be 
displayed in the notes area. If there is trouble with anything, an error or 
warning message will be displayed in the notes area; you should then
correct the error and click <b>Create</b> again.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Editing an existing Light</h3>
To edit an existing Light, follow  this procedure:
<ol>
	<li>Edit of an existing Light may be started in either of two ways:
	<ul>
		<li> Click on a Light's <b>Edit</b> button in the Light Table.</li>
		<li> Enter the system name of the Light to be edited in the 
	Add/Edit Light window and click the <b>Edit</b> button at 
	the bottom of the Add/Edit Light window.  This must be the same 
	as the system name shown in the Light Table.</li>
	</ul>
	The <b>Create</b> and <b>Edit</b> buttons at the bottom of the Add/Edit 
	Light window will change to <b>Update</b> and <b>Cancel</b>.</li>
	<li> Make whatever changes or additions you need to the information in
	the dialog. Note that the system name of the edited Light may not be 
	changed, but the user name may be changed. Other items are as described 
	<A HREF="#addLight">above</a>.</li>
	<li>After making changes to the Light information, click <b>Update</b> 
	to change the selected Light.  If everything is fine, a 
	message stating "Light updated ... " will be displayed in the notes 
	area.  If there is any trouble, an error or warning message will be 
	displayed in the notes area, and the update is stopped for you to 
	correct the error and click <b>Update</b> again.</li>
	<li>Click <b>Cancel</b> to exit edit mode without changing the 
	selected Light. If the Add/Edit Light window is dismissed (closed) 
	while in edit mode, <b>Cancel</b> is automatically selected, and no 
	changes are made to the selected Light.</li>
</ol>

<A ID="lightcontrol"><H3>Automated Control Options for Lights</H3></a>

The operation of a Light can be controlled in the following ways:
	<ul>
	<li><p><b>By Sensor</b> - The Light will be turned on when the sensor
	changes to active or inactive, depending upon the choice made in the 
	'Sense for ON' popup menu, and it will be turned off, when the sensor
	reverses state.  Specify the sensor by entering its name 
	(system name or user name) in the 'Sensor Name' field. This option has 
	a number of uses, including setting a fascia panel light to follow block
	occupancy. That is useful, for example, for monitoring train position in
	a hidden staging area.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p><b>By Fast Clock</b> - The Light will be turned on when the fast
	clock reaches the time entered in 'Time On' and will be turned off when
	the fast clock reaches the time entered in 'Time Off'.  The times are 
	entered in "hh:mm" format, where "hh" is hours and "mm" is  minutes for a
	24-hour clock. One use of this option is to turn on and off scenery 
	lighting, street lights, house lights, etc. to simulate night time on the 
	layout.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p><b>By Turnout Status</b> - The Light will be turned on when the 
	turnout changes to closed or thrown, depending upon the choice made in the 
	'Status for ON' popup menu, and it will be turned off, when the turnout
	reverses its status.  Specify the turnout by entering its name 
	(system name or user name) in the 'Turnout Name' field. This option may 
	be used to set a fascia panel light to follow the status of a turnout. 
	That is useful, for example, for monitoring the status of hidden turnouts.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li><p><b>By Timed ON</b> - The Light will be turned on when the trigger
	sensor changes to active, and it will be turned off, when the specified 
	time has elapsed. Specify the trigger sensor by entering its name 
	(system name or user name) in the 'Trigger Sensor Name' field. Enter
	the time the Light is to remain on (in milliseconds) in the 'Duration ON'
	field. This option has a number of uses, it was originally designed to 
	turn on an electromagnetic decoupler in response to a fascia pushbutton, 
	but it can also be used for other types of layout animation, for example, 
	to control the ringing of a crossing bell when a train enters a block.</p>
	</li>
	</ul>
