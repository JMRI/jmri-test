<H2>The Turnout Table</H2>

<P>This table contains a list of all turnouts that exist for this
panel.</P>
<BR>
<H3>Turnout Table Buttons and Checkboxes</H3>

<UL>
	<LI>User Name <BR>
	You can directly enter or change the "User Name" for an existing
	turnout.</LI>
	<LI>Cmd<BR>
	Pushing the "Cmd" command button will change the state of an existing
	turnout.</LI>
	<LI>Delete<BR>
	Pushing the "Delete" button will remove the turnout from the table. To permanently
	delete the turnout you must save the panel.</LI>
	<LI>Inverted<BR>
	When checked, the turnout command and status to and from the layout is
	inverted. For example, an inverted turnout means that when JMRI sends a
	"CLOSE" turnout command, it becomes a "THROW" to the layout. Turnouts
	that can not be inverted have grayed out boxes and can not be checked.</LI>
	<LI>Locked<BR>
	When checked, the turnout is locked. This means that turnouts that can
	be locked by JMRI will not respond to commands from cabs to change.
	Turnouts that can not be locked have grayed out boxes and can not be
	checked.</LI>
	<LI>Feedback<BR>
	This shows the known state of a turnout.</LI>
	<LI>Mode<BR>
	This allows you to change how the turnout will operate.</LI>
	<LI>Sensor 1<BR>
	Shows the system name of the optional sensor that provides the feedback
	for a turnout. You can also directly enter or change the system name of
	Sensor 1 for a turnout.</LI>
	<LI>Sensor 2<BR>
	Shows the system name of the optional sensor that provides the feedback
	for a turnout. You can also directly enter or change the system name of
	Sensor 2 for a turnout.</LI>
	<LI>Add<BR>
	Pressing this button allows you to add a new turnout.</LI>
	<LI>Show feedback information<BR>
	When checked, the optional feedback columns are shown.</LI>
</UL>

<BR>
<H3>NCE Turnout lock feature</H3>

<P>The turnout lock feature allows you to selectively disable
accessory (turnouts) commands from cabs. By locking a turnout, the JMRI
program will monitor the turnout's accessory address and if it detects a
change command from a cab, will cancel the command immediately by
sending out the opposite command to the turnout.</P>
<P>To use this feature you must select MONITORING as the feedback mode for
the turnout and the NCE command station must have the 2007 or newer EPROM.</P>
<P>To help you select a set of turnouts to lock, a route can be
locked. All turnouts that are being monitored by the JMRI program and
are included in the route will be locked.</P>
