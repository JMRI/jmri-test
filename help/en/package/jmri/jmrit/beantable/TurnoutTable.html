<H2>The Turnout Table</H2>

<P>This table contains a list of all turnouts that exist for this
panel. From this table you can change the state of a turnout, change the
feedback mode, enter sensors for feedback, invert, lock, and delete it.</P>
<BR>
<H3>Turnout Table Buttons and Checkboxes</H3>

<DL>
	<DT>System Name</DT>
	<DD>The System Name cannot be changed once entered into the table.
	The "Add" button located in the lower left corner of the table allows
	you to add a new turnout to the table. You must use a valid System Name
	for a turnout. See <A HREF="../../../../html/doc/Technical/Names.html">Names</A>
	for more info.</DD>

	<DT>User Name</DT>
	<DD>You can directly enter or change the "User Name" for an
	existing turnout. This can be pretty much anything you wish to describe
	the turnout.</DD>

	<DT>Cmd</DT>
	<DD>Pushing the "Cmd" command button will change the state of an
	existing turnout.</DD>

	<DT>Delete</DT>
	<DD>Pushing the "Delete" button will remove the turnout from the
	table. To permanently delete the turnout you must save the panel.</DD>

	<DT>Inverted</DT>
	<DD>When checked, the turnout command and status to and from the
	layout is inverted. For example, an inverted turnout means that when
	JMRI sends a "CLOSE" turnout command, it becomes a "THROW" to the
	layout. Turnouts that can not be inverted have grayed out boxes and can
	not be checked.</DD>

	<DT>Locked</DT>
	<DD>When checked, the turnout is locked. There are two types of
	locks supported by JMRI, cab lockout and pushbutton lockout. When a
	turnout is locked, only turnout commands from JMRI to move a turnout
	will work. Cabs and pushbuttons on the layout are disabled. You can
	selectively decide if you want "both" cabs and pushbuttons locked,
	"cabs only", or "pushbuttons only". Click the "Show lock information"
	box on the lower edge of the table for the lock options. Not all
	stationary decoders support pushbutton lockout, and not all systems
	support cab lockout. Turnouts that can not be locked have grayed out
	boxes and can not be checked. See <A HREF="#NCE Turnout lock feature">NCE
	Turnout lock feature</A> below.</DD>

	<DT>Feedback</DT>
	<DD>This shows the known state of a turnout.</DD>

	<DT>Mode</DT>
	<DD>The pull down boxes allow you to select the method of
	operation for a turnout. See <A HREF="#JMRI:Turnout Feedback">JMRI:
	Turnout Feedback</A> below.</DD>

	<DT>Sensor 1</DT>
	<DD>Shows the system name of the optional sensor that provides the
	feedback for a turnout. You can also directly enter or change the
	system name of Sensor 1 for a turnout.</DD>

	<DT>Sensor 2</DT>
	<DD>Shows the system name of the optional sensor that provides the
	feedback for a turnout. You can also directly enter or change the
	system name of Sensor 2 for a turnout.</DD>

	<DT><A NAME="Lock Mode"></A>Lock Mode</DT>
	<DD>Shows which lockouts are active for this turnout. "Both" means
	that cabs and pushbuttons will be locked out if the lock is active.
	"Cabs only" means that cabs will be locked out, but pushbuttons will
	continue to work when the lock is active. And "Pushbuttons only" means
	that pushbuttons will be locked out, but cabs will continue to work
	when the lock is active. Note, when JMRI locks a turnout's pushbutton,
	it does so by sending a lock command to the turnout decoder's lock
	control CV register. You must unlock the turnout before shutting down
	the JMRI program if you want to restore the operation of the
	pushbuttons. Cab lockout automatically terminates when the JMRI program
	is shut down.</DD>

	<DT>Decoder</DT>
	<DD>Shows which decoder the turnout is using. Currently the
	program only supports NCE and CVP stationary decoders. CVP decoders
	support one or two pushbutton operation. Select the number of
	pushbuttons used to operate that specific turnout. CVP_AD4_1B means one
	button, and CVP_AD4_2B means two buttons. We recommend that you enter
	all four CVP turnouts per decoder into the turnout table, even if
	you're only locking one. You do not need to specify the number of
	pushbuttons for NCE.</DD>

	<DT>Add</DT>
	<DD>Pressing this button allows you to add a new turnout.</DD>

	<DT>Show feedback information</DT>
	<DD>When checked, the optional feedback columns are shown.</DD>

	<DT>Show lock information</DT>
	<DD>When checked, the optional lock columns are shown.</DD>

<H3><A NAME="JMRI:Turnout Feedback"></A>JMRI: Turnout Feedback</H3>

<P>Model railroaders want different things when it comes to knowing
the status of the turnouts on their layout. Some are quite happy to say
"I told it to move, that's good enough for me". These people don't worry
about whether a turnout on their layout actually moved when they told it
to. Those people can just ignore this page, and leave the JMRI settings
at their default.</P>

<P>But some modelers want to have better information about the
status of the turnouts on their layout, and so use some form of
"feedback" to indicate turnout position. This could be as complicated as
two microswitches, adjusted to only close when the turnout is properly
seated in either position. Or it could be something simpler.</P>
<P>In the JMRI program, Turnout objects actually know about two
different states: "Commanded" state and "Known" state. The commanded
state is "This is what was asked for last". The known state is "This is
what's happening on the layout as far as I know".</P>
<P>Built into NCE, LocoNet and XPressNet systems are limited
abilities to monitor what is happening on their networks. This allows
JMRI to capture messages or poll the system concerning Turnout state
changes. All the other protocols normally use a "you told it to change,
so it did" logic. In other words, when something in the code (the
Turnout Tool or a script) commands a state change from closed to thrown,
the default is for both both the commanded state and the known state to
change to "thrown".</P>
<P>But it is also possible to control this in more detail if you
have wired your layout to allow it.</P>
<P>The whole question of turnout feedback is then "How do we
configure the program to understand the known state properly, given my
layout hardware?"</P>
<P>In the turnout table (Tools->Tables->Turnouts) click on the box
in the lower left that is labeled "Show feedback information". Now
expand the turnout table window and you'll find four columns associated
with feedback:</P>
<DL>
	<DT>"Feedback"</DT>
	<DD>This is the "known state". You can't change it, but this
	column will show you what the program thinks it is.</DD>

	<DT>"Mode"</DT>
	<DD>This is the feedback method used by this turnout. (You can
	change it for each turnout individually, but note the change doesn't
	take effect until you click somewhere else, and you might need to add
	some sensor names in the next column(s))</DD>

	<DT>"Sensor 1", "Sensor 2"</DT>
	<DD>These define the sensors needed by certain types of feedback.
	You can type a sensor number, system name or user name here; the
	program will change it to the system name that it needs.</DD>
</DL>

<P>Available feedback modes are:</P>
<DL>
	<DT>DIRECT</DT>
	<DD>The default in many cases, and also the original behavior of
	the program. When something tells the turnout to change, it's just
	immediately assumed that it actually did it.</DD>

	<DT>ONESENSOR</DT>
	<DD>The turnout watches the sensor defined by the "Sensor 1"
	column, which is probably hooked to a microswitch on the turnout or
	similar. When the sensor is Active, the turnout is known to be in the
	"Thrown" position. When it's Inactive, the turnout is known to be in
	the "Closed" position.</DD>

	<DT>TWOSENSOR</DT>
	<DD>The turnout watches two sensors defined by the "Sensor 1" and
	"Sensor 2" columns, which are probably hooked to microswitches at
	either end of the turnout's throw bar. When Sensor 1 is active, the
	turnout is known to be thrown. When Sensor 2 is active, the turnout is
	known to be closed (normal).</DD>

	<DT>MONITORING</DT>
	<DD>Default for LocoNet turnouts (and probably XpressNet soon),
	and available for NCE. When selected, the network is monitored for
	messages about the status of the turnout. This mode is only available
	for certain systems, i.e. some systems can't do the monitoring
	properly, and don't have this choice.</DD>

	<DT>INDIRECT</DT>
	<DD>Currently only available for LocoNet turnouts, this informs
	the program that the turnout is being driven by a Digitrax DS54 with a
	microswitch attached to the switch lead. For more information, see the
	JMRI <A
		HREF="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/doc/Technical/loconet/DS54.html">DS54</A>
	examples page on the JMRI website.</DD>

	<DT>EXACT</DT>
	<DD>Currently only available for LocoNet turnouts, this informs
	the program that the turnout is being driven by a Digitrax DS54 with
	two microswitches attached to the switch and aux leads. For more
	information, see the JMRI <A
		HREF="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/doc/Technical/loconet/DS54.html">DS54</A>
	examples page on the JMRI website.</DD>

<BR>
<H3><A NAME="NCE Turnout lock feature"></A>NCE Turnout lock feature</H3>

<P>The turnout lock feature allows you to selectively disable
accessory (turnouts) commands from cabs. By locking a turnout, the JMRI
program will monitor the turnout's accessory address and if it detects a
change command from a cab, will cancel the command immediately by
sending out the opposite command to the turnout.</P>
<P>To use this feature you must select MONITORING as the feedback
mode for the turnout and the NCE command station must have the 2007 or
newer EPROM.</P>
<P>To help you select a set of turnouts to lock, a route can be
locked. All turnouts that are being monitored by the JMRI program and
are included in the route will be locked.</P>
