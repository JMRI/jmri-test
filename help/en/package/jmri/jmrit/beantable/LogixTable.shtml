<H1>The Logix Table</H1>
	<p> A Logix is a small group of Conditionals focused on a single task 
	on the layout. Each Conditional may be viewed as a statement of the form:
	<ul>if (logical expression) then (action).</ul>
	The "logical expression" part of a Conditional tests the state of a group
	of user-specified conditions on the layout, for example, whether certain
	turnouts are closed or thrown, or whether a block is occupied. The "action" 
	part of the Conditional specifies what action is to be taken if the state of 
	the logical expression changes.</p>
	<p> The Logix Table lists all currently defined Logixs by their system name 
	and user name. The last column of the table provides an easy way to edit a 
	Logix and its Conditionals. Simply clicking the <b>Edit</b> button for a Logix, 
	will bring up the Edit Logix window. The Edit Logix window also provides for 
	deleting a Logix.</p>
	<p>The <b>Enabled</b> column allows you to enable (checked) or disable 
	(unchecked) a Logix. A Logix does not have a state as many JMRI entities do.  
	A Logix does have the capability of being "enabled" or "disabled". When a Logix 
	is not enabled, the logical expressions of its Conditionals are still evaluated,
	but the actions specified in the Conditionals are not taken. When a Logix is 
	enabled after having been disabled, its Conditionals are recalculated and 
	appropriate actions taken.</p>  
	<p>To create a new Logix, click the <b>Add</b> button at the bottom of the Logix 
	Table.  This will bring up a Create Logix window.  Entering a system name
	and a user name, then clicking <b>Create Logix</b>, will create the Logix, and 
	bring up the Edit Logix window. Once a Logix is created, its system name cannot 
	be changed. Its user name, however, may be changed in either the Logix Table or 
	the Edit Logix window. A new user name may be any useful text, provided the new 
	user name was not previously assigned to another Logix.</p>
	<p>The <b>File</b> menu at the top of the Logix Table provides for printing this 
	table and for storing the Logixs and their Conditionals in a layout 
	configuration file.  Selecting either store option will bring up a dialog for
	naming a configuration file for writing Logix information and all other 
	configuration information (e.g., sensors, lights, turnouts, signal heads, 
	routes etc.). If you are updating an existing file, simply click its name, and 
	it will be copied into the name entry.</p>
	<p>For more information, consult the Logix documentation on the JMRI web page
