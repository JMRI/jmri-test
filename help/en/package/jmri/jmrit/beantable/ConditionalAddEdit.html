<H2>Adding/Editing Logix Conditionals
</H2>
	<p>The Edit Conditional window is where logical expressions are set up and 
	where actions are specified.  The Edit Conditional window is
	displayed when a Conditional is created, or when the <b>Edit</b> button of a 
	Conditional is pressed in the Edit Logix window.  The Edit Conditional 
	window displays the system name and user name of the Conditional at the 
	top. The system name is automatically set by the program and cannot be changed.
	The user name may be edited by entering/modifying the text in the User 
	Name field. The user name may not be the same as the user name of another 
	Conditional in this Logix, but may be the same as the user name of a Conditional
	in a different Logix.</p>
	<p>Next are two sections--one for the setup of a logical expression
	and one for set up of actions. Conditionals are statements of 
	the form:
	<ul>if (logical expression) then (action).</ul>
	A Conditional has two distinct parts: its "logical expression" 
	and its "action". The window has separate sections for set up of each.</p>
	<p>The logical expression section contains a table of state variables, with 
	two buttons below. Press the <b>Add State Variable</b> to add a state 
	variable (a row in the state variables table). The first column in the 
	state variables table displays an automatic AND when appropriate. The 
	second column contains a choice box that allows the user to select the NOT
	operator as needed. The third column contains a scrolling choice box, 
	allowing selection of state variable type.  Next are three 
	columns, Name, Data 1, and Data 2, that are used to provide needed
	information for the selected variable type. When a variable type is 
	selected, N/A (for Not Applicable) is displayed in data entries that are 
	not needed to define the state variable, and a prompt message telling what
	to enter in the remaining column(s) is displayed below the table (above the
	two buttons). Available state variables are documented 
	<a href="#variable">below</a>. When a name is entered, it must correspond to 
	the system name or the user name of an existing entity (sensor, turnout, light, 
	etc.). It is useful to open the Sensor Table when entering sensor 
	names, or the Turnout Table to show available turnouts, etc. </p>
	<p><b>Caution:</b> If you use user names to specify state variables, be very careful 
	about changing these user names.  User names may be edited in JMRI, but changing 
	user names without good reason can break your state variable definitions. If you 
	want to be able to freely change your user names, specify state variables using 
	system names, which cannot be changed.</p>
	<p>The last column of the table (<b>Delete</b> buttons) is used to delete a state 
	variable if you decide it is no longer needed. The State column of the table 
	shows the state (true or false) of each
	state variable when it is evaluated. The state displayed includes the 
	effect of the NOT operator, if NOT is selected. For the logical expression,
	and therefore the Conditional, to calculate true, all state variables must 
	evaluate to true.</p>
	<p>At any time during the entry 
	of state variable data, <b>Check State Variables</b> may be 
	clicked to check entered data and evaluate state variables. When
	this button is pressed, checking and evaluation proceeds until the
	check completes successfully, or an error is detected. If an error is 
	detected, checking stops for you to correct the error and click
	<b>Check State Variables</b> again. <b>Please remember after editing 
	name and data items to click a different cell in the table before 
	clicking Check State Variables (or Update Conditional at 
	the bottom of the window) so that the program is notified that you have 
	finished your entry. Otherwise your entry may not take effect, and an error 
	may be reported unnecessarily.</b></p>
	<p>The action section of the Edit Conditional window provides for specifying
	up to two actions to be taken when a Conditional is calculated. If either 
	action is not needed, select "None" for type in the scrollable selection 
	box. Otherwise select an action type in the type box, and data items needed 
	to completely specify the action will appear to the right of the type box. 
	If you don't know what needs to be entered in a data field, hover your 
	cursor over it, and a hint message will appear. When a name must be 
	entered, the name must correspond to the system name or the user name of an 
	existing entity (sensor, turnout, signal head, etc.) of the proper type. 
	Opening the Sensor Table when entering sensor names, or the Turnout Table to 
	see available turnouts, etc., may be useful. Available action types are described
	in detail <a href="#action">below</a>.</p>
	<p><b>Caution:</b> If you use user names to specify actions, be very careful 
	about changing these user names.  User names may be edited in JMRI, but changing 
	user names without good reason can break your action definitions. If you 
	want to be able to freely change your user names, specify actions using 
	system names, which cannot be changed.</p>
	<p>For each action, three options are available for when to trigger the
	action: 1) On Change to True, 2) On Change to False, and 3) On Change. These
	refer to the calculated state of the Conditional, which is equal to
	the value of the logical expression as specified in the state variable table. 
	One of these options must be selected. Click the radio button next to an 
	option to select it and deselect the other two.</p>
	<p>When the logical expression and actions have been specified, click 
	<b>Update Conditional</b> at the bottom of the window. This initiates a
	check of the logical expression (the same as done by <b>Check State 
	Variables</b>) and a check of entered data for actions. If the user name has
	been edited, it is also checked. If an error is found, a 
	message box opens announcing the error, and the update is stopped to allow 
	you to correct the error and click <b>Update Conditional</b> again. 
	If no error is found, the Conditional is updated
	with the entered data, the Edit Conditional window is closed, and the user
	is returned to the Edit Logix window.</p>
	<p> Two other buttons are available at the bottom of the Edit Conditional 
	window. Clicking <b>Cancel</b> will close the Edit Conditional window 
	without updating the Conditional. Clicking <b>Cancel</b> results in loss
	of any data that has been entered. The other button, <b>Delete 
	Conditional</b>, provides an easy way to delete an unneeded Conditional. 
	Click <b>Delete Conditional</b> to delete the Conditional being edited and 
	return to the Edit Logix window.</p>
	
	<p>Available state variables and actions are listed below. For more 
	information, consult the Logix documentation on the JMRI web page 
	http://jmri.sourceforge.net/ .</p>
	
<dt class=left><a name=variable><H3>Available State Variables</H3></a></dt>

	<p>State variables that are currently available for use in Conditionals
	are listed below, along with information on each. State variables
	must always evaluate to either true or false. The condition resulting in 
	true is given for each. If the condition is not met, the state variable
	evaluates to false. When a Logix is active, the states of entities (sensor,
	turnout, light, etc.) specified in state variables in its Conditionals are 
	monitored. A calculation of all Conditionals in the Logix is triggered
	when any monitored state changes as noted below (if not obvious).
	    <ul>
		<li><b>Sensor Active</b>: Evaluates to true if the state of the
		specified sensor is active. 
		<li><b>Sensor Inactive</b>: Evaluates to true if the state of the
		specified sensor is inactive. 
		<li><b>Turnout Thrown</b>: Evaluates to true if the known state of the
		specified turnout is thrown. 
		<li><b>Turnout Closed</b>: Evaluates to true if the known state of the
		specified turnout is closed.
		<li><b>Conditional True</b>: Evaluates to true if the state of the
		specified conditional is true. 
		<li><b>Conditional False</b>: Evaluates to true if the state of the
		specified conditional is false. 
		<li><b>Light On</b>: Evaluates to true if the 
		specified light is on. 
		<li><b>Light Off</b>: Evaluates to true if the 
		specified light is off. 
		<li><b>Memory Equals</b>: Evaluates to true if the value saved in the
		specified memory is the same as the value specified in the state 
		variable. Calculation is triggered when the monitored memory value
		changes to or from the specified value.
		<li><b>Fast Clock Range</b>: Evaluates to true if the current fast clock
		time is between the begin time and end time specified for the range.  
		Times must be specified in hh:mm format, where hh is hours and mm is 
		minutes, relative to a 24-hour clock.  Calculation is triggered when the 
		fast clock time enters the range and when the fast clock time exits the 
		range.
		<li><b>Signal Red</b>: Evaluates to true if the appearance of the 
		specified signal head is red. Calculation is 
		triggered when the appearance change to or from red.
		<li><b>Signal Yellow</b>: Evaluates to true if the appearance of the 
		specified signal head is yellow. Calculation is 
		triggered when the appearance change to or from yellow.
		<li><b>Signal Green</b>: Evaluates to true if the appearance of the 
		specified signal head is green. Calculation is 
		triggered when the appearance change to or from green.
		<li><b>Signal Dark</b>: Evaluates to true if the appearance of the 
		specified signal head is dark. Calculation is 
		triggered when the appearance change to or from dark.
		<li><b>Signal Flashing Red</b>: Evaluates to true if the appearance of 
		the specified signal head is flashing red. Calculation 
		is triggered when the appearance change to or from flashing red.
		<li><b>Signal Flashing Yellow</b>: Evaluates to true if the appearance of 
		the specified signal head is flashing yellow. Calculation 
		is triggered when the appearance change to or from flashing yellow.
		<li><b>Signal Flashing Green</b>: Evaluates to true if the appearance of 
		the specified signal head is flashing green. Calculation 
		is triggered when the appearance change to or from flashing green.
		<li><b>Signal Lit</b>: Evaluates to true if the specified signal head is 
		lit. 
		<li><b>Signal Held</b>: Evaluates to true if the specified signal head 
		is being held. 
    	</ul>
