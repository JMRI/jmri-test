<H2>Adding/Editing Transits</H2>
    
<a name="addTransit"><H3>Adding a new Transit</H3></a>
To add a new Transit, follow this procedure:
<ol>
<li><p>Click <b><a href="TransitTable.shtml">Transits</a></b> in the 
<b>Tables</b> submenu of the <b>Tools</b> menu to bring up
the Transit Table, and click the <b>Add...</b> button at the bottom of the 
table to bring up the Add/Edit Transit window.</p>
<img src="TransitAddFrame.jpg" height="384" width="578"/>
<li><p>Enter a <b>System Name</b>, according to the JMRI convention. Since Transits 
are internal objects, the first letter should be "I" (for internal). The second 
letter should be "Z" to indicate a Transit. This is usually followed by a 
number, but the program will accept any numeric or alphabetic characters. The 
system name must be different from the System Name of other Transits. JMRI will 
force all alphabetic characters in the System Name to upper case.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enter a <b>User Name</b>. Any string of characters that is different 
from the User Name of other Transits will be accepted, but it's 
wise to use a string that describes the intended use of the Transit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next add <b>Sections</b> to the Transit.  Every Transit must have at least 
one Section, but most will have many more. Sections must be connected,and must 
be entered in order. Select the Section you would like to begin the Transit 
in the upper popup menu. At any point during Section addition, this popup menu lists 
only those Sections that are eligible for addition. Click <b>Add Next Section</b> 
to add the first Section of the Transit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add more Sections and alternates in the same manner. Select the Section 
to be added in the popup menu, and click <b>Add Next Section</b>. If at any time 
you decide you want to start over, click <b>Delete All Sections</b> to clear the 
table of Sections, and return to step 4 above.</p>
<p>Immediately after entering a Section, if you would like to add an <b>Alternate 
Section</b> to the one just entered, select an alternate Section from the lower 
popup menu. If there are no possibly valid alternate Sections, the lower popup 
menu will be empty. Often the lower popup menu will contain possible alternate 
Sections that are not really alternates to the primary Section. For a listed 
alternate Section to be a <i>valid</i> alternate Section, it must connect to 
the next primary Section. <b>It is your responsibility to determine whether a 
Section listed in the lower popup menu is a valid alternate Section.</b> 
For more information on alternate Sections and their use, refer to the 
<a href="TransitTable.shtml">Transit Table help file</a>.
</li>
<li><p>Next set any <b>Special Action</b> needed when a train has completely 
entered a Section.  The entries in the Special Action column are popup menus 
with <none> as the default entry. Currently only two Special Actions are 
provided. Selecting <b>Pause For</b> and entering a fast clock pause time
(in minutes) will provide for an automatic station stop or similar action. 
Entering <b>Await Restart</b> will cause the train to delay in that Section, 
for example, if a set out or pick up needs to be made. More information is 
provided in the <a href="TransitTable.shtml">Transit Table help file</a>.</p>
</li>
</li><li><p>Click the <b>Create</b> button at the bottom of the window.  
If everything is fine, the window will close and a new Transit will appear in 
the Transit Table. If there is trouble with anything, a message will be 
displayed indicating the error and what you should do to fix it. 
Correct the error and click <b>Create</b> again.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Editing an existing Transit</h3>
To edit an existing Transit, follow  this procedure:
<ol>
<li><p>Click a Transit's <b>Edit</b> button in the <a href="TransitTable.shtml">
Transit Table</a> to bring up the Add/Edit Transit window. The window will 
be the same as that shown above, except the System Name will be fixed, and 
the <b>Create</b> button will be replaced with an <b>Update</b> Button.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make whatever changes or additions you need to the information in
the window. Note that the System Name of the edited Transit may not be 
changed, but the User Name may be changed. Items that may be edited are described 
<A HREF="#addTransit">above</a> in steps 3 through 6 in the procedure for adding 
a new Transit.</p></li>
<li><p>After making changes to the Transit information, click <b>Update</b> 
to change the selected Transit.  If everything is fine, the window will close.
If there is any trouble, a message will be displayed indicating the error and 
what you should do to fix it. Correct the error and click <b>Update</b> again.</p>
</li>
<li>Click <b>Cancel</b> to exit without changing the selected Transit. 
If the Add/Edit Transit window is dismissed (closed) while editing, <b>Cancel</b> 
is automatically selected, and no changes are made to the selected Transit.
</li>
</ol>
