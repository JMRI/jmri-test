<H1>The Signal Table
</H1>

<A href="../../../../html/tools/images/SigTable.gif"><IMG SRC="../../../../html/tools/images/SigTable.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="375" HEIGHT="166" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0" ALT="Simple Signal Logic panel figure"></a>

<p>All the signals that JMRI knows about can be referenced
using the "Signal Table" tool in the Tools menu of most JMRI programs.
There are eight columns in the table:
<UL>
<LI>The system name is assigned to the signal when it's created, 
and can't be changed.
<LI>If you're interested in having your signals carry "human readable"
names, you can click in the "User Name" column and change that information
to whatever you want.
<LI>As the signal changes, for whatever reason, the current
appearance will show in the table in the "State" column.  You can also click on the
appearance button to cycle through the available appearances:
red, yellow, green, flashing red, flashing yellow, flashing green, and dark.
<LI> The "Comment" column is for your use to record any comment you may want
to help keep track of your signal heads. It is for information only.
<LI>Click the "Delete" button in a specific row to delete the signal head. 
Remember to remove any signal head icons associated with this signal head 
and all references to this signal head. Use this button with caution!
<LI>The check box in the "Lit" column lets you control whether the
signal head on the layout is lit (checked) or stays dark (unchecked).
<LI>The check box in the "Held" column shows the "held" property of the
signal, and allows you to change it.  This property is used by e.g. CTC
machine logic to say "Don't change this signal head from red, even if it 
would be safe to do so, because I want to hold a train here".
<LI>Click the "Edit" button in a row to view or change optional information
for a signal head. Notes: System name and type cannot be changed. Only one 
signal head may be edited at a time.
</UL>
<P>To define a new signal, click on the 
"<A HREF="SignalAddEdit.shtml">Add.." button</a>.
It will
prompt you for the type (Triple Output; Double Output; SE8c; etc), and
whatever setup information is needed.
<P> Use the Store item in the File menu to save signal information to disk. This information is saved with the configuration in an XML file, along
with control panel setup and similar stuff.  To store your panels in the same 
file (recommended), select <b>File>Store>Store Configuration and Panels To 
File...</b> or select <b>Panels>Store panels...</b> in the main JMRI window.
<P>For more information on creating and displaying panels, including how to 
show signals on your panels, please see the 
<A HREF="../../../../html/apps/PanelPro/Panels.shtml">Panels pages</a>.
