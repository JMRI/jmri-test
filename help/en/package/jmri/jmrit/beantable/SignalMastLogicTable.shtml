<H1>The SignalMast Logic Table</H1>

<P>A SignalMast logic, consists of a destination Mast, one or more turnouts, 
block, sensors or other signalmasts that must be in a specific state before the 
source signalmast can be set from a "Danger" aspect.
<P>If you have drawn up your layout on layout editor correctly with all the block 
information then it is possible for the system to automatically build up all 
the SignalMast source and destination pairs, along with blocks, turnouts and their 
settings.
<H2>SignalMast Logic Table Columns</H2>

<DL>
	<DT>Source</DT>
	<DD>This is the signal mast that you wish to set the logic up from.  There
    can be multiple instances of the source mast in the table, depending upon
    the number of different destination masts that are reachable from it.
    <br>
    Consider it as the signal mast that the driver is currently facing.</DD>

    <DT>Appearance</DT>
    <DD>The current appearance of the source mast</DD>
    
	<DT>Destination</DT>
	<DD>This is the destination signal mast which is next down the line from the
    source mast.  There can be multiple instances of the destination mast, all 
    with different source masts.
	</DD>

    <DT>Appearance</DT>
    <DD>The current appearance of the destination mast</DD>

    <DT>Comment</DT>
    <DD>A free form user editable field for the user to assign comment against 
    the logic</DT>

	<DT>Delete</DT>
	<DD>Pushing the "Delete" button will remove the Signal Mast Logic from the
	table. 
	<p>
	Note that this doesn't remove the Signal Mast Logic from any files you've
	saved that contain it.  If you load one of those files, perhaps
	when you restart the program, the route will reappear.
	You should use one of the "Store to file" options in the "File"
	menu to save new versions of any files that contain this route.
	</DD>


	<DT>Enabled</DT>
	<DD>To disable a SignalMast Logic from triggering, uncheck the "Enabled" box
	for the route.</DD>

	<DT>Edit</DT>
	<DD>Push this button to edit the Signal Mast Logic. For more information see <A
		HREF="SignalMastLogicAddEdit.shtml">Adding/Editing Signal Mast Logic</A>.</DD>
</DL>

<H3>Add SignalMast Logic</H3>

<DD>This is done via the Add button at the bottom of the screen, for more information
on editing and adding Signal Mast Logics see
