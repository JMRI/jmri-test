<H2>Adding/Editing Routes
</H2>
    
<p>The first thing you must do when creating a route is name it. In
the box labeled "Route System Name" enter a unique name for your route.
You can optionally enter a more descriptive name in the "Route User
Name" box.</p>
<p>The radio button below the "Route User Name" allows you to show
only the turnouts or sensors that are part of this route. There are two
tables below the "Show" button, the first one contains turnouts and the
second contains sensors. Click the "Include" box in either table to add
the desired turnouts or sensor to your route. Next to the "Include" box
is the action that the turnout or sensor can perform when the route is
triggered. For example, if you wish the turnout to throw when the route
is triggered select "Set Thrown" in the drop down box.</p>
<p>Below the turnout and sensor tables are two optional features. By
hitting the "Set" button you can add a sound file that you wish to play
when the route is triggered, or a script file that you want to run.</p>
<p>To trigger a route, you need to specify how the route is to be
activated. You can select up to three sensors and one turnout. Of any of
the sensors or turnout meets the condition that you specify, the route
will trigger.</p>
<p>In some cases, it might be necessary to delay or slow down the
rate that JMRI sends commands to change turnouts on the layout. By
entering a value in the "Added Delay" box, you can increase the amount
of time between turnout commands when this route is triggered.</p>
<p>The next text box allows you to enter a turnout that will lock
this route.</p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with your route, use the "Add Route"
button to create the route. To save your route you must use the "Store
Panel" command which can be found under the "Panels" main menu. If you
decide that you need to change your route, use the "Edit" and "Update
Route" buttons to modify your route.</p>

<p></p>
<H3>NCE turnout lock feature</H3>

<p>The turnout lock feature allows you to selectively disable
accessory (turnouts) commands from cabs. By locking a turnout, the JMRI
program will monitor the turnout's accessory address and if it detects a
change command from a cab, will cancel the command immediately by
sending out the opposite command to the turnout.</p>
<p>
To help you select a set of turnouts to lock, a route can be locked. All
turnouts that are being monitored by the JMRI program and are included
in the route will be locked. In the route edit window, an optional
lock control turnout is available. You can use the lock control turnout
to enable or disable the locks from a panel icon. The lock control
turnout can be an internal or external turnout. To use this new feature
the system must be NCE using 2007 EPROM or newer, and the turnouts to be
locked must use MONITORING for feedback.
