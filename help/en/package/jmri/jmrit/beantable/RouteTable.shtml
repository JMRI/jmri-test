<H2>The Route Table</H2>

<P>A route consists of one or more turnouts or sensors that you
would like to control. Before creating a route, you should first add
some turnouts or sensors by using either the turnout table or sensor
table. These tables can be found under the main menu "Tools -> Tables"</P>
<P>Once you have some turnouts or sensors to manage use the "Add"
button in the lower left hand corner of the route table to create a new
route.</P>

<H3>Route Table Buttons and Checkboxes</H3>

<DL>
	<DT>System Name</DT>
	<DD>The System Name cannot be changed once entered into the table.
	The "Add" button located in the lower left corner of the table allows
	you to add a new route to the table.</DD>

	<DT>User Name</DT>
	<DD>You can directly enter or change the "User Name" for an
	existing route.</DD>

	<DT>Set</DT>
	<DD>Pushing the "Set" button will trigger an existing route.</DD>

	<DT>Delete</DT>
	<DD>Pushing the "Delete" button will remove the route from the
	table. To permanently delete the route you must save the panel.</DD>

	<DT>Enabled</DT>
	<DD>To disable a route from triggering, uncheck the "Enabled" box
	for the route. Enabled is not saved and will be restored when a panel
	is loaded at startup.</DD>

	<DT>Locked</DT>
	<DD>When checked the route is locked. This means that turnouts
	that can be locked by JMRI will not respond to commands from cabs or
	pushbuttons to change. For more information see Turnout Table, <A
		HREF="TurnoutTable.shtml#Lock Mode">Lock Mode</A> and <A
		HREF="#NCE turnout lock feature"> NCE turnout lock feature</A>.</DD>

	<DT>Edit</DT>
	<DD>Push this button to edit the route. For more information see <A
		HREF="RouteAddEdit.shtml">Adding/Editing Routes</A>.</DD>

<P>The turnout lock feature allows you to selectively disable
accessory (turnouts) commands from cabs. By locking a turnout, the JMRI
program will monitor the turnout's accessory address and if it detects a
change command from a cab, will cancel the command immediately by
sending out the opposite command to the turnout.</P>
<P>To help you select a set of turnouts to lock, a route can be
locked. All turnouts that are being monitored by the JMRI program and
are included in the route will be locked. In the route edit window, an
optional lock control turnout is available. You can use the lock control
turnout to enable or disable the locks from a panel icon. The lock
control turnout can be an internal or external turnout. To use this new
feature the system must be NCE using 2007 EPROM or newer, and the
turnouts to be locked must use MONITORING for feedback.</P>
