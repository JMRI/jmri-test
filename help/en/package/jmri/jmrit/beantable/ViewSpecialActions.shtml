<H1>Special Actions</H1>
    
<H2>What are Special Actions?</H2>
<p>Special Actions are things that can be initiated automatically as a train 
running in automatic mode traverses the layout. One or more Special Actions may be 
requested for each Section in a Transit. If a Section is in a Transit multiple 
times, different Special Actions may be specified for each occurence of the 
Section. Special Actions only apply to automatically running trains with a 
<i>virtual engineer</i>.  If running trains in automatic mode is of interest 
read on. If your trains will only be run manually with a human engineer, 
Special Actions aren't used.</p>

<p>Special Actions are in addition to the <i>standard actions</i> that also 
happen automatically when a train runs in automatic mode. Some standard actions 
are things like following signals and using stop sensors, that are specified with 
each Section. <i>Standard actions</i> occur automatically whenever a Section is 
traversed in automatic mode. Other <i>standard actions</i> include automatically 
requesting allocation of Sections, and automatically releasing Sections when 
they are no longer needed.</p>

<p>Special Actions are tied to Sections, but are specified at the Transit level 
to provide maximum user flexibility. A Section is a piece of physical track, 
that may, for example, be used by passenger trains, through freight trains, or 
locals. Each of these uses may need different Special Actions in a specific 
Section. For example, a passenger train may make a station stop in a particular 
Section, whereas a through freight train may go straight through. Placing 
Special Actions in Transits allows Active Trains traveling the same path 
through the layout to have different Special Actions.</p>

<h2>Requesting a Special Action</h2>

<p>A Special Action is requested by specifying <i>what</i> action to be 
initiated and <i>when</i> that action is to be initiated. Any <i>when</i> event 
may be combined with any <i>what</i> action, providing a wide variety of Special 
Actions. Currently available <i>when</i> events are:</p>

<p><ul>
<li><b>Entry to Section</b> - When the automatic train enters the current 
Section.
<li><b>Exit from Section</b> - When the automatic train exits the current 
Section. This means when the last detectable car leaves the Section, and the 
Section is unoccupied.
<li><b>Entry to Block in Section</b> - When the automatic train enters a 
specified Block in the Section. For Sections with only one Block, this is 
equivalent to <b>Entry to Section</b>.</li>
<li><b>Exit from Block in Section</b> - When the automatic train exits a 
specified Block in the Section. This means when the last detectable car leaves 
the specified Block, and the Block is unoccupied. For Sections with only one 
Block, this is equivalent to <b>Exit from Section</b>.</li>
<li><b>When Train Stops</b> - When the automatic train stops. This may be 
used, for example, for stopping the bell in a sound decoder or initiating other 
actions when the train stops at a station.</li>
<li><b>When Train Starts</b> - When the automatic trains starts up after having 
been stopped. This may be used, for example, to initiate actions when a train 
starts up after a station stop.</li>
<li><b>When Sensor goes Active</b> - When the specified Sensor moves to the 
active state. The specified Sensor may be either internal or hardware, and must 
be in the Sensor Table. This might be used, for example, with a hardware Sensor 
connected to a fascia push button to resume automatic operation after being in 
manual mode, when the user pushes the fascia button to indicate manual operation 
work has been completed. It can also be used to trigger actions using 
position sensors on the layout.</li>
<li><b>When Sensor goes Inactive</b> - When the specified Sensor moves to the 
inactive state. This is the same as above, but with the opposite sensor state. 
Use the one that best fits your hardware.</li>
<li><b>When Train is Within the Section</b> - When the last detectable car enters 
the Section, and the previous Section goes unoccupied.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>An optional delay, specified in milliseconds, is available for each <i>when</i> 
event. No delay is the default.  If an optional delay time is not entered (or a 
delay time of zero is entered), the action will be initiated immediately after 
the <i>when</i> event occurs. If a delay time is specified, the program will wait 
for the specified time after the <i>when</i> event occurs before initiating the 
action.</p>
<p>Currently available <i>what</i> actions are:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Pause</b> - Stop the train for a specified number of fast clock minutes. 
This item may be used to request a station stop.</li>
<li><b>Set Maximum Speed</b> - Set the maximum speed to a specified percentage 
of the maximum hardware speed. When a train is run in automatic mode, the 
program will never exceed the maximum speed. For example, this item may be used 
to force an automatic train to run slower through a town. Setting maximum speed 
does not affect the current speed of the train if it is less than the specified 
maximum speed.</li>
<li><b>Set Train Speed</b> - Set the current train speed to the target value. 
The change will not occur instantaneously. The current speed will be changed to 
the target speed in a manner determined by the program. The target speed may be 
either lower or higher than the current value.</li>
<li><b>Ramp Train Speed</b> - Set the current train speed to the target value 
by ramping to the target value over a specified time period. The target speed 
may be either lower or higher than the current value.</li>
<li><b>Go to Manual Mode</b> - Drop out of automatic mode to allow a human 
engineer to perform work with a manual throttle. The train will remain in 
manual mode until the following action occurs.</li>
<li><b>Resume Automatic Operation</b> - Resume automatic operation after 
having been in manual mode to allow a human user to work with a manual 
throttle.</li>
<li><b>Start Bell Ringing</b> - Start bell ringing on a sound decoder. This 
item will turn throttle function 1 on.</li>
<li><b>Stop Bell Ringing</b> - Stop bell ringing on a sound decoder. This 
item will turn throttle function 1 off.</li>
<li><b>Sound Horn</b> - Sound the horn of a sound decoder for a specified 
time. This item is equivalent to holding down throttle function 2 for the 
specified time.</li>
<li><b>Patterned Sound Horn</b> - Sound the horn in a manner specified by 
a pattern. The pattern consists of short and long blasts, specified as "s" 
and "l" in the pattern. For example a pattern of "lsl" specifies long-short-
long. The user sets the duration of the short and long blasts.</li>
<li><b>Set Decoder Function</b> - Press the specified decoder function button. 
The function button is specified by the user.</li>
<li><b>Set Sensor Active</b> - Set a specified Sensor active. The specified 
Sensor must be in the Sensor Table. If the specified Sensor is already in the 
active state, it is toggled. This action may be used, for example, with an 
internal sensor to trigger a Logix or a Route, or to set a Light. It offers 
access to a wide variety of actions not included here.</li>
<li><b>Set Sensor Inactive</b> - Set a specified Sensor inactive. The specified 
Sensor must be in the Sensor Table. This is equivalent to the action above, 
except with a different target Sensor state.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>The View Special Actions Window</h2>
<p>The <b>View Special Actions</b> window displays Special Actions that are 
currently set, and provides for adding, editing, or deleting Special Actions. 
The View Special Actions window (example below) is displayed for a specific 
Section in a Transit by pressing the <b>View Special Actions</b> button on that 
Section's row in the <b>Add/Edit Transit</b> window.</p>
<img src="ViewSpecialActions.jpg" height="363" width="765"></li>
<p>For all Special Events that have been created, the <i>when</i> event and the 
<i>what</i> action are described in the <b>When</b> and <b>Action Requested</b> 
columns. To add a new Special Action, click <b>Add New Action</b> to bring up the 
<b><a href="AddEditAction.shtml">Add/Edit Action</a></b> window. To edit an 
existing Special Action, click the <b>Edit</b> button in its row. To delete an 
existing Special Action, click the <b>Delete</b> button in its row. 
The order of the Special Actions is not important.</p>
<p>When the Special Actions are completely defined, click the <b>Done</b> button.
