<H1>Dispatcher Options
</H1>
<H2>Introduction
</H2
<p>The <b>Options Window</b> provides for tailoring 
<b><a href="Dispatcher.shtml">Dispatcher</a></b> options according 
to user needs and preferences. The <b>Options Menu</b> provides access to Dispatcher 
options and provides for saving Dispatcher options on disk for later use. Both 
are described below in detail. Available Dispatcher options are described fully 
in the following section. 

<H2>Using the Options Window
</H2
<p>Selecting <b>Options Window...</b> in the <b>Options</b> menu of the Dispatcher 
window brings up the window shown below.</p>
<img src="OptionsWindow.jpg" height="312" width="519">

<p>This window shows options currently selected for Dispatcher. To change 
Dispatcher options, change to the desired option configuration, and 
click the <b>Apply</b> button. All options are set to the selections in the 
Options window, and the Options window disappears. To dismiss this window without 
changing any options, click the <b>Cancel</b> button. Each option is explained 
below:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Check <b>Use connectivity from Layout Editor panel:</b> and select a 
Layout Editor panel (if there's more than one panel), if you have a Layout Editor 
panel that fully describes your layout, including blocks and turnouts, and would 
like Dispatcher to make use of this connectivity. Uncheck this item if no 
Layout Editor panel with full connectivity is available.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select one of the three options for Dispatcher to select trains from 
when creating Active Trains. The three possibilities are:</p></li>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Trains from Roster</b> - Dispatcher will list all trains in the JMRI 
	Roster that are not currently in Active Trains.</li>
	<li><b>Trains from Trains</b> - Dispatcher will list all trains available 
	from Operations that are not in Active Trains.</li>
	<li><b>Trains from User Entry</b> - Dispatcher will replace the train 
	selection box in the 
	<b><a href="NewTrain.shtml">Activate New Train</a></b> window with two 
	entry fields allowing the user to enter a train name and a dcc Address.
	</li></ul>
<li><p>Check <b>Layout has block detection hardware</b> if block occupancy 
detection is available from the layout. Uncheck if the layout does not have block 
occupancy detection, or if Dispatcher should not make use of block occupancy 
detection.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Check <b>Automatically allocate Sections to Active Trains</b> to activate 
automated dispatching. Uncheck to deactivate automated dispatching features. 
This item is equivalent to the <b>Auto Allocate</b> item in Dispatcher's 
<b>Options</b> menu.
</li>
<li><p>Check <b>Automatically set turnouts when a Section is allocated</b> to 
activate automatic setting of turnouts. Uncheck to deactivate automatic 
setting of turnouts. This item is equivalent to <b>Auto Set Turnouts</b> in 
Dispatcher's <b>Options</b> menu.
</li>
<li><p>Check <b>Use short Active Train names</b> to use the train name as the 
Active Train name in tables and selection boxes where Active Trains are 
referenced. Uncheck to use the full Active Train name in those locations.
</li>
<li><p>Check <b>Place train name in starting Block</b> to request that 
Dispatcher set the "value" of the starting Block to the train name when 
creating a new Active Train. Uncheck to suppress setting the starting Block 
value to the train name. This feature is designed to facilitate Train 
Tracking in Layout Editor panels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note: Automated dispatching and automatic setting of turnouts are not 
implemented in the initial version of Dispatcher.</b> These functions will 
be available in a later version of Dispatcher.</p>
<H2>Using the Options Menu
</H2
<p>The <b>Options</b> menu is used to access, edit, and save Dispatcher options. 
Items in this menu and their use are explained below:
<ul>
<li><p><b>Auto Allocate</b> - This check box is used to turn automated 
dispatching functions on (checked) or off (unchecked). This item is equivalent 
to an item in the Options Window. Automated dispatching may be turned on or off 
at any time. The item is repeated here for convenience of the dispatcher.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Auto Set Turnouts</b> - This check box is used to turn on (checked) 
or off (unchecked) automatic setting of turnouts when Sections are allocated. 
This item is equivalent to an item in the Options Window. Automatic setting of 
turnouts may be turned on or off at any time. The item is repeated here for 
convenience of the dispatcher.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Options Window...</b> - Selecting this item brings up the Options 
Window described above.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Save Options...</b> - Selecting this item saves Dispatcher options 
currently in effect into a small XML file (<i>dispatcheroptions.xml</i>) in the 
user's preferences directory. This is the same location where JMRI preference 
files are saved. When Dispatcher is started, if a file named 
"<i>dispatcheroptions.xml</i>" is found in the user's preference directory, 
that file is read, and Dispatcher options are set accordingly.  If the 
file is not present when Dispatcher is started, default options are used. 
<b>Note: Dispatcher options are not saved automatically.</b> Saving Dispatcher 
options is optional. Selecting this menu item is the only way to save 
Dispatcher options.<p>
</li>
