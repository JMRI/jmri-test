<H1>The Image Index Editor</H1>

This window is used to create an Image Index.  The index may be organized
according to any taxonomy you wish.  Using it allows you to access any
image file that is accessible from your computer without moving or copying
the file.  It is similar to a table of contents or index that you might 
find in a reference textbook. 


<H2>Contents of the Image Index Editor</H2>
<p>
The window contains two panes side by side.  The left side is your current 
Image Catalog.  This is what the Icon Editors have been using to change
icons.  The top panel of this pane consists of one or more trees.  The default tree
is "resourceJar", the catalog of all the image files downloaded with the
version of JMRI you are using.  These are files encapsulated in "jmri.jar".
Another default tree may be "preferenceDir", the catalog of all the image 
files contained in the "resources" directory in your JMRI preferences directory.
If you have not created a "resources" directory in your JMRI preferences directory
you will not see this tree.  Other trees that you may see are those that you have
installed after using the <b>Open Directory</b> menu item in one of the Icon Editor 
windows and pressed the <b>Add to Catalog</b> button.  Below the trees is a "Preview"
panel that displayes the images found in any node that you have selected from
one of the above trees.
</p>
<p>
The right side is the Image Index you may edit.  It is similar to the right pane
in that the top panel is the tree of the Index you are creating.  Likewise, the 
bottom panel displays the
images found in any node of the tree that you select.

Drag any icon from the bottom (left) panel of the Catalog pane to a node of the Index tree 
(right) pane and that icon is registered in the Index.
</p>
<p>
Using the <b>Open Directory</b> menu item in the <b>Find Icons</b> memu will let you
choose adirectory that has additional images.  Icons can be dradgged from these 
directories and dropped into a Index node.
