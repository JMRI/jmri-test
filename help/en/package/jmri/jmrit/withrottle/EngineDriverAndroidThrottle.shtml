JMRI: Engine Driver Throttle for Android
</h1>


<img src="images/EngineDriverIcon.png" height="72" width="72" align="right">

Update: Engine Driver version 0.2 is now available. This minor enhancement includes
support for ZeroConf, allowing you to connect to the WiThrottle server without having to
enter it's IP address and TCP port.
<p>
This application can connect to a JMRI WiThrottle server running on a PC, 
and in turn control your locomotives. Speed, direction, and 15 functions are supported. 
Due to it's early release, it is rough around the edges, has a number of caveat, 
and requires some development procedures to get running. 
If you feel brave enough, here is what you need to do: (This will be simpler with
<a href="http://jmri.org/releasenotes/jmri2.9.2.shtml">JMRI 2.9.2</a>,
due out at the end of January)

<p>

Before your Android device will allow you to install this program, 
you will need to permit the installation of non-Market applications. 
This is under Settings->Applications->Unknown sources (at least on Android 2.0). 
Then you can use your phone to 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmri/files/test%20files/Engine_Driver-debug_v0.1.apk/download">download this file</a>, 
and select it for installation.

<p>
These instructions are for Engine Driver 0.1. You can still follow them for Engine Driver 0.2, but this
version also will discover your WiThrottle server.
You will need to know your computer's IP address. 
You will also need to know the TCP port that the JMRI WiThrottle is listening on. 
In order to do this, first download the latest version of JMRI (2.9.1 at the time of writing). 
Then modify the default.lcf file that comes with JMRI in a text editor. 
Where it says log4j.rootCategory= INFO, change INFO to DEBUG. 
Otherwise install JMRI as normal. Start JMRI (LocoTools is fine), 
and then start the WiThrottle server in Debug->Start WiThrottle Server (last menu entry). 
Log output will include the TCP port that this server is listening on.

<p>
With the IP address and the TCP port, you have everything you need to connect Engine Driver up to JMRI. 
You should have your Android device configured to obtain an IP address from your Wi-Fi router,
and it is through that connection to the "layout" PC that the two can communicate.
After you have connected, enter your locomotive address and select the correct address length. 
Finally you should be able to run the engine. 
Be sure that you have turned on track power, the throttle can not yet do that for you.

<p>
Current version is 0.2, available for download at:<br>
