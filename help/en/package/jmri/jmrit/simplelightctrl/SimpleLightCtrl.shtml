<H2>Light Control</H2>

Enter the light system name for the
light you wish to control in the box to right of "light:". For
example, entering 678 and by pressing either the On or Off
button, you should be able to change the state of light number 678
on the layout. Another example, a valid light system name for PowerLine devices
could be PL9. Then by pressing either the On or Off button, you
should be able to change the state of light on
the layout. Another example, a valid light system name could be IL123
which is internal light number 123. Pressing Thrown or Closed will
only change the state of the internal light and will not change a
light on the layout. See "
<A HREF="../../../../html/doc/Technical/Names.html">Names</A>
" under general help for more information.

<H3>Light Control Buttons and Status</H3>

<DL>
	<DT>current state:</DT>
	<DD>Shows the current known state of the light. A light can
	have two states: on, and off. The on and off states are what the JMRI
	program knows or believes is the state of the light.</DD>

	<DT>On</DT>
	<DD>Push this button to turn on the light.</DD>

	<DT>Off</DT>
	<DD>Push this button to turn off the light.</DD>

<h3>Powerline Devices</h3>

Powerline devices have defined On as a increase brightness by one unit.
Off is defined as dim by one unit.
This is a temporary feature until we decide how to deal with dimmable settings.
