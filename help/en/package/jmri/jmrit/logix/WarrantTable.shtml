<H1>Creating and Editing Warrants</H1>

A Warrant contains the information needed to run a train. This includes
the DCC address of the locomotive(s), 
the route train will take, the settings of the turnouts
to traverse the route and the throttle commands to use
at various points along the route - e.g. speed, when to show lights, sound horns,
bells or other sound effects.
<ul>
        <b>NOTE:</b> Warrants can only be created if the PanelPro configuration 
        has at least two OBlocks defined.
</ul>
There are three steps in creating a warrant, define the route, select a 
train and record the throttle commands.
</p>
<H2>Defining a Warrant Route</H2>
Routes are created using the <b>Define Route</b> tab in the Edit Warrant window.</p> 

<H3>Origin, Destination and Via Blocks</H3>
A warrant route is created by selecting the the Block and path where
the train will begin its trip and the portal by which it should leave.  Then
select the Block and path and entry portal of the path where the train should end its trip.
Press the <b>Calculate Route</b> button and the the computer will determine all the
intermediate paths needed to make the trip.
<ul>
        <b>NOTE:</b> in the upper right hand portion of the Create/Edit 
        Warrant frome is a table listing all the OBlocks you have defined.
        Either the System Name or the User Name can be dragged and dropped
        into the location blocks on the upper left hand side of the frame.
</ul>
<ul>
        <li><b>Originating Location</b>: - Consists of a text field for the
        originating <b>Block Name</b>, a drop down menu to choose the starting
        <b>Path Name</b> and a drop down menu to select the <b>Exit Portal
        Name</b>.
        <br>Note that the block may have several paths and the default path
        showing may not be the one where you intend the train to start.
        <br> 
        Also, Since paths usually have two portals, the default portal
        showing may not be the one the train should pass through.
        <p>
        Setting the Exit Portal determines the direction the train will
        take.  There is no further need to specify direction, since the 
        algorithm will provide the route.</li>

        <li><b>Destination Location</b>: - Consists of a text field for the
        destination <b>Block Name</b> and a drop down menu for the terminating
        <b>Path Name</b> and a drop down menu to select the <b>Entry Portal
        Name</b>.
        <br>Note that the block may have several paths and the default path
        showing may not be the one where you intend the train to finish its run.
        <br> 
        Also, Since paths often have two portals, the default portal
        showing may not be the one the train should pass through. Specifying 
        an Entry portal for the destination is needed for layouts containing 
        reversing loops.
        Dog-bone layouts in particular typically have additional routes through
        their reversing loops so specifying the Entry portal helps in reducing
        the number of unwanted routes.  
        <p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Via Location</b>: - Consists of a text field for the
        destination <b>Via Name</b> and a drop down menu for the terminating
        <b>Path Name</b>.
        <br>Typically, it is not necessary to enter any block name in this 
        field, since it likely the algorithm will detect the route
        you want.  This group of entries is used when there are multiple 
        routes possible from origin to destination.   Entering a block and
        path will make the computer contimue its search for a route that 
        passes through the selected block and path.
        </li>
</ul>
More information about <b>OBlocks</b>, <b>Portals</b> and <b>OPaths</b>
can be found at <a href="OBlockTable.shtml">The Occupancy Block Tables</a>.
</p>
<H3>Calculate and Debug</H3>
After the origin and destination blocks and paths have been chosen, press
the <b>Calculate Route</b> button.  Frequently, more than one route will be found.
The "Searching for Route" text box will show some statistics on the number of routes
and their length in blocks that have been found while searching for routes.  
The text field "Max Number of Blocks in Route" limits how far the computer will look
routes.  The <b>Stop</b> button will terminate
the search for routes.  After the Stop button is pressed or the computer exhausts
all the possible routes less than or equal the "max length", it presents a list 
of those that it found and their lengths.
Choose a route by pressing its radio button.  Pressing the <b>Review</b> button 
will display the route for you to examine in the Route Table. Each block, path 
and portals used to traverse the route is displayed. 
</p><p>
You may inspect all the routes in this 
manner.  Choosing a route and pressing the <b>Select</b> button will 
dismiss the dialog. and bring up the <b>Record/Playback Script</b> tab.
If exactly one route is found, the list dialog is skipped.  
</p><p>
Sometimes the dialog message "No Route found 
from "Origin Block', path ..." etc. is displayed. Responding <b>Yes</b> to the
question, "Show the search tree?" will open a window with a graphic description of 
all paths begining at the Origin block, path and exit portal.  Trace what you 
believe to be a likely route by clicking on the nodes.  Each node is a block
path and will display its path and block name and the entry and exit portals
it uses.  At the end of each branch, the leaf node will be the point 
where the route could not continue.  Normally these leaves are spurs.
However, these are also the places where you may find an error or
omission that you made when defining the OBlocks, OPaths and Portals.
</p>

<H2>Record/Playback Script</H2>
You pick the engine to power your train and record its actions from this panel.  
You also can test and modify the recorded script here.

<H3>Choosing a train</H3>
If you have defined an JMRI engine roster, the train names are displayed in
the <b>Engine Roster</b> drop down ComboBox.  Selecting a name from this list
will fill in the text fields:
<b>Train Name</b>, <b>Road Name</b> and <b>Number</b>, <b>DCC Adddress</b>.
<p>
You may also choose a train by entering a DCC address in the <b>DCC Adddress</b>
text field.  This address will be used whether or not it is found in the
IJMRI engine roster. 
</p>

<H2>Learn Mode</H2>
Throttle commands are created by recording the commands you send to a train
while operating it manually from a screen throttle in <b>Learn Mode</b>.

<H3>"Teaching" a Train</H3>
Pressing the <b>Start</b> button in the <b>Learn Mode</b> box
will display a throttle on the screen.  
Operate the train just as you would with any other throttle.  All speed 
changes and button presses on the throttle are recorded in the Throttle 
Command Table.
<p>
Pressing the <b>Stop</b> button will end the recording.
</p><p>
The learn script should be done with a completely clear route - All turnouts 
set, all blocks unoccupied (except origin), all signals set for
clear runing and no changes made during recording
period.  When the train is run executing the script, any changes in these
completely conditions will be taken into account and the train's speed and schedule
will be altered accordingly.
</p

<H3>Running a Train</H3>
As a safety feature, whenever a warranted train has permission to enter the 
next block, the turnouts are (re)set.   Having permission from signals means 
that resetting the turnouts should not interfere with any interlocking logic.  
In the absence of signals, occupancy or allocation to another warrant also 
may deny permission.  It is the most restrictive of these three conditions 
that gives the auto-run train permission to proceed.  When such a denial is 
cleared, the train will proceed automatically.  The only thing that overrides 
having permission to proceed is if the user has set the control to "Halt".  The train will 
not move until the user sets "Resume". (see below how to set these user commands.
</p>   
<H3>Throttle Command Table</H3>
The Throttle Command Table has the following columns:
<ul>
        <li><b>ET(msec)</b>: - The elapsed time in milliseconds to wait after 
        a command is sent before issuing the next throttle command.</li>
        <li><b>Command</b>: - The throttle command that was recorded (direction, speed, 
        or button press or release).</li>
        <li><b>Value</b>: - The value of the command.</li> 
        <li><b>Block</b>: - The block the train has last entered when the throttle
        command was recorded.</li>
</ul>
In addition to the commands you entered from the throttle, a marker when each
block is entered is also recorded.  A marker row in the table has the elapsed time from 
the last throttle command, the command name "NoOp" (i.e. no command was send to the 
train), the value "Enter Block" and the block name being entered.  These rows help
to synchronize the running of the train to keep to its recorded schedule. 
</p><p>
All of the columns in the Throttle Command Table can be edited.  Perhaps you want to
touch up the horn blasts or modify the speeds.  Just enter the data you want.
</p>

<H3>Synchronizing Commands to Block boundaries.</H3>
The "NoOp" markers attempt to shorten or lengthen the elapsed time to synchronize
the entry into each block at the same time as was recorded.
If the consist of a train changes, or if power is changed, the recorded elapsed times
may not allow the throttle commands to execute at the same points on the route where
the "Learn Mode" train recorded them.  The "NoOp" markers can usually correct this. However, 
in extreme cases or for commands issued within the block sychronization may
still be uncorrected.
<p>
If this is the case, a <b>Throttle Adjustment</b> can be entered to multiply the throttle setting
to supply more or less power. 
<ul>
        <b>NOTE:</b>The throttle adjustment factor is not permanently saved.  The default 
        mutiplier is always 1.0.  Whenever a factor is wanted, it must be entered manually 
        each time the warrant is run. - <b>or be set by Logix</b> when Logix is used to set 
        the trainId and run the warrant.  The recorded and edited throttle commands are the 
        base settings for each warrant run.  TrainId and Throttle Factor can be set as desired
        for each warrant run.
</ul>
</p>

<H3>Running Trains on Dark Blocks.</H3>
The Learn mode and Run Mode functions can be used on blocks that do not have detection sensors.
However, without detection, other than the initial setting of turnouts, the warrant
cannot reset the turnouts or modify its speed while the train is enroute.  This means
there is no protection from rouge trains fouling the route or from turnouts being changed
while the train is enroute.  Therefore run trains
with caution over dark blocks.

<H2>Run Mode</H2>
Pressing the <b>Run</b> button in the <b>Run Train</b> box
will send the throttle commands to the train specified in the warrant.
<ul>  
        <b>NOTE:</b>Be sure that the train is located on the Path of the Origin block 
        of the route and the direction of the engine is compatible with the first direction
        specified in the throttle commands.
</ul>
The <b>Run Train</b> box will display each block entered by the train as it traverses
the route.  Each time an auto running train enters a block it check the succeeding two 
blocks for occupancy.  Depending on what is detected, signals are set for clear, approach
or stop and the current speed is modified accordingly (normal, limited or stop).  This
check for occupancy will also reset the turnouts for the route, if they have been 
inadvertently changed from another source.
<p>
The occupancy detection and synchronized commands used to notify a train when it enters
a block depends on accuracte occupancy detection.  If the layout does not have reliable 
occupancy detection, automated trains may run with unexpected consequences.  Trains may
wait indefititely when false detection occurs.  The block
protection done when entering a block can be disabled.  The following radio buttons set 
this:
<ul>
        <li><b>Run with block Protection</b>: - Runs the train with the occupancy detection
        when entering blocks and with the synchroniation features.</li>
        <li><b>Run with blocks dark</b>: - Runs the train as described for Dark Blocks.</li>
</ul>

<H3>Controls</H3>
The <b>Run Train</b> box also is a drop down ComboBox that has the following commands
that can be sent to the train.
<ul>
        <li><b>Halt</b>: - Stops the train.</li>
        <li><b>Resume</b>: - Restarts the train at the speed setting it had when stopped.</li>
        <li><b>Abort</b>: - Terminates the automated run.</li> 
</ul>

<H2>Save Etc.</H2>
There are three buttons at the bottom of the window.

<ul>
        <li><b>Save</b>: - Saves the warrant so it can be shown in the list of warrants on the
        Warrant Table.  A permanent copy of the warrant is saved when the panel is
        saved to the Configuration file.</li>
        <li><b>Cancel</b>: - Cancels any editing that may have been done.</li>
        <li><b>Delete</b>: - Deletes the warrant when the panel is
        saved to the Configuration file.</li> 
</ul>
