<H1>Warrants</H1>

A Warrant is a collection of information sufficient to run an automated train.
It will set the turnouts for a specified route and detect whether there are any
other trains occupying it.
A JMRI Warrant is suggestive of what a warrant does on a prototype railroad, but
there is no intention to replicate any particular railroad's mode of
operation.
<p>
<b>Warrants</b> depend on having an accurate description of the layout in terms of
<b>OBlocks</b>, <b>Portals</b> and <b>OPaths</b>.  These elememts are
created using the <b>Occupancy Block Tables</b> that you will find under 
the <b>Tools</b> menu in the PanelPro window.  Their definitions
and how to use them are described in 
<a href="OBlockTable.shtml">The Occupancy Block Tables</a>.
<p>

<H2>Creating a Warrant</H2>
In order to create a <b>Warrant</b> you must first have created two or more OBlocks.
These blocks don't have to be fully defined, but their existence indicates that you 
are interested in using Warrants.
When two or more OBlocks exist    
the Panel Editor will display a <b>Warrants</b> menu with three
menu items.  Otherwise, this menu is not displayed.  The Warrant menu items are:
<ul>
        <li><b>Warrant List</b>: - Opens a table of warrants from which you
        can control warrant routes and dispatch trains.  It is not meant 
        to be a dispatchers panel, but its intended use is testing
        warrants.  You are encouraged to develop your own dispatchers
        panel using the Warrant state variables and actions in Logix.
        The operations of this table are discussed below.
        </li>
        <li><b>Edit Warrant...</b>: - Shows the list of existing  warrants.
        Selecting one will open a Warrant Editing Window.  The
        operations of this frame are discussed in <A HREF="WarrantTable.shtml">
        Creating and Editing Warrants</A>.
        </li>  
        <li><b>Create Warrant</b>: - Opens a blank Warrant Editing Window to 
        create a new warrant. The
        operations of this frame are discussed in <A HREF="WarrantTable.shtml">
        Creating and Editing Warrants</A>.</li>
</ul>        

<H2>Functions of a Warrant</H2>

<H3>Creating Routes</H3>
Routes are created from the <b>Define Route</b> tab.</p>
<p>
A warrant route is a series of block paths linked together so a train
may travel over it.  A warrant route is created by first choosing an <b>origin
block</b>, a starting path and a portal to exit the orginating block.  Then,
<b>destination block</b> is chosen and a path on which to end the route.  Blocks
are chosen either by typing in the block name or dragging it from a displayed 
OBlock table.  A computer algorithm
will determine all the intermediate blocks and paths to make the route.
<p>
The origin block is obviously where a train given this route will start and the
starting path within the origin block is the track it is on - e.g. "Departure Track #3".
Choosing the portal of the path where the train should exit, determines the
direction of the train on the route.  From here on, the computer algorithm will
find portals, paths and blocks to take the train to the destination block and
path - e.g. "Arrival Track #1" in the destination block.</p>
<p>
There may be more than one way to get from the origin track to the destination
track. The computer presents you with a list of all the routes it finds - 
some of these may be quite lengthy.  You may review and choose the route you
want to use from the list.  If the list is too lengthy, you may restrict the number
of routes found by specifying an 
intermediate </b>via block</b> and path that must be included in the route.  The
computer will re-calculate the route with this restriction and present you only with
routes through the specified "Via" block and path.
<A HREF="WarrantTable.shtml"> Creating and Editing Warrants</A>.</li> has more
information about this.</p>
<p>
The computer may not find a route from the origin track to the destination
track that you believe is there.  When this occurs, you may request the computer
to display the routes the algorithm has attempted.  As you trace the  
attempted routes you
may find that you have forgotten to enter a path or miss-labeled the correct portal
to a path.  (or, heaven forbid! found a bug.)</b></p>
<p>When you are satisfied with the route, select the <b>Record/Playback Script</b> tab.</p>

<H3>Choosing a Train</H3>
Inside the <b>Choose Engine Consist</b> box you will find 
a drop dowm 'combo box' labeled <b>Engine Roster</b> that displays all the trains
listed in the Roster.  Selecting one will assign a train to the warrant.
<p>
If you do not have a Roster defined then you may enter a locomotive's address in the
<b>DCC address</b> text field and a train responding to this address can be 'taught',
the commands it should issue, and later, 'run'. 
<A HREF="WarrantTable.shtml"> Creating and Editing Warrants</A>.</li> has more
information about this.</p>
<p>

<H3>Learn Mode Throttle</H3>
If a train has been assigned, that is, has a valid train Id or valid DCC address in the warrant,
then a throttle can be aquired by pressing the <b>Start</b> button.  This
throttle will operate the acquired train and all the throttle commands will be
recorded until the <b>Stop</b> button is pressed.
<A HREF="WarrantTable.shtml"> Creating and Editing Warrants</A>.</li> has more
information about this.</p>

<H3>Recorded Throttle Commands</H3>
The throttle commands recorded in <b>Learn Mode</b> can be edited, however,
caution should be taken to only make modest changes since new commands
when executed in playback could cause dramatic events.  It may be wiser to
re-record the commands in a new Learn Mode session if major changes are made. 
<A HREF="WarrantTable.shtml"> Creating and Editing Warrants</A>.</li> has more
information about this.</p>

<H3>Running Automated Trains</H3>
The recorded throttle commands can be played back to run the train.  When in 
<b>Run Mode</b>, additional control of the train can done through three choices: <b>Halt</b>,
<b>Resume</b> and <b>Abort</b>.  As suggested by the names, these command stop a running
automated train, restart it or stop the train and abort the remaining throttle commands.
<p>
Although there are separate operations to reserve a warrant route (Allocate) and
set turnouts and signals (Set Route) these operation do not have to be done to run
an automated train.  A <b>Run</b> operation can begin without them.  The train will
seek allocation and set turnouts and signals as it proceeds on the route.  When
confronted with an occupied block, the train will stop and wait until the block clears.
When the next block is clear but the block beyond the next block is occupied, the
train will approach at reduced speed.  An automated train will attempt to secure
allocation of the next two blocks each time it enters a block. 
<A HREF="WarrantTable.shtml"> Creating and Editing Warrants</A>.</li> has more
information about this.</p>

<H3>Editing Throttle Commands</H3>
The recorded throttle commands execute according to the elapased time between commands.
The elapsed time (ET column) may be modified and even the command may be changed. 
<p>
Changing the consist of a train or perhaps even a temperature change 
between recording and playback, may result in the train not performing a throttle
command at the same place on the layout each time.  If it is important to have the 
command happen at a precise control point (e.g. a block boundary portal), then the
throttle command can be synchronized to execute at that point. 
<p>
The run protection discussed in the previous section and synchronizing commands
depends on reliable occupancy detection.  If the layout is prone to have spurious 
false detection signals, then automated running will be unsatisfactory - trains may wait
indefinitely for phantom trains to release occupancy or run indefinitely by not
receiving a synchronizing signal.  The train can be run using the elapsed times
between commands only and skip the block protection mentioned above.

<H2>Using the Warrant List</H2>
The <b>Warrant List</b> menu item opens the <b>Warrant Table</b>.  Each row is a
warrant that has been created.  Warrant routes can be reserved, the turnouts and
signals set and trains run and controlled using the columns in the table.

<H3>Columns in the Warrant Table</H3>
<ul>
        <li><b>Warrant</b>: - The name of the warrant.</li> 
        <li><b>Route</b>: - The route of the warrant is listed in a drop dowm combo box.</li>
        <li><b>Train Name</b>: - The Train Id, as stated in the Roster.</li>
        <li><b>DCC Address</b>: - The DCC Address of the locomotive or consist.</li>
        <li><b>Allocate</b>: - A button that reserves the route for the warrant.</li>
        <li><b>Deallocate</b>: - A button that removes the reservation for the warrant.</li>
        <li><b>Set</b>: - A button the sets the turnouts for the warrant route.</li>
        <li><b>Run</b>: - A button that runs the train over the route according to the automated throttle commands.
        The recorded speed of the train will be modified according to the occupancy and signal aspects
        encountered on the route.</li>
        <li><b>Control/Status</b>: - The status of the warrant is shown.  It also has a drop down combo box that
        can send the following commands to a running train.  <b><i>Note</b>: This column has two functions -
        Status messages and control buttons.</i>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Halt</b>, <b>Resume</b> and <b>Abort</b> commands to an automated running train.</li>
        <li><b>Edit</b>: - A button that opens an editing window for the warrant,</li>
        <li><b>Delete</b>: - A button that deletes the warrant.</li>
        </ul></li>
</ul>
<H2>Using Warrants in Logix</H2>
Several of the operations that can be done from the Warrant List and Warrant Editing frame
can be done with Logix Conditionals.  You may design and implement a dispatcher's panel
using the Warrant state variables and actions found in Logix.

<H3>Warrant State Variables</H3>
<ul>
        <li><b>Route is Free</b>: - True when all blocks in the warrant route are not allocated
        to anyone and are not occipied.  False otherwise.</li>
        <li><b>Route is Set</b>: - True when all blocks in the warrant route are allocated and the
        turnouts set for this warrant.  False otherwise.</li>
        <li><b>Route is Allocated</b>: - True when all blocks in the warrant route are allocated
        to this warrant.  False otherwise.</li>
        <li><b>Route is Occupied</b>: - True when none of the blocks in the warrant route, other
        than the origin block, are occipied.  (Assumes the train of this warrant is occupying
        the origin block).  False otherwise. </li>
        <li><b>Train Running</b>: - True when the train specified in the warrant is running 
        either in Learn Mode or Auto Run Mode.  False otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<H3>Warrant Actions</H3>
<ul>
        <li><b>Allocate</b>: - Allocates the route to this warrant.</li>
        <li><b>Deallocate</b>: - Deallocates the route of this warrant (only).  This will not
        deallocate the route of a different warrant.</li>
        <li><b>Set Route</b>: - Sets the signals and turnouts for the route as far along the
        route that it can until it reaches an occupied block or a block allocated to another 
        warrant.</li>
        <li><b>Run</b>: - Issue the throttle commands to the train in the warrant.  This
        should only be done when the train occupies the Origin block.</li>
        <li><b>Set TrainId</b>: - Set the engine consist to be used in the warrant from a trainId 
        in the Engine Roster.</li>
        <li><b>Control Train</b>: - Send a control command (<b>Halt</b>, <b>Resume</b> or 
        <b>Abort)</b> to a running train under warrant.</li>
        <li><b>Set Throttle Factor</b>: - Set a multiplier for the recorded throttle setting.
        When the engine or consist of the train is changed, more or less power may be required.</li>
</ul>
