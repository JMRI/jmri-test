<H2>Create/Edit Block
</H2>
<p>    
Blocks are sections of track whose occupancy may be individually monitored. 
Dividing track into blocks is optional. Blocks set up in a track diagram 
normally correspond to physical blocks on a layout. Block occupancy is indicated 
by the state of an <i>occupancy sensor</i>. When a layout's track is divided 
into blocks, all of the track need not belong to a block. For example, yard track
is normally not in a block, whereas mainline track almost always would be divided 
into blocks. The main use of blocks is to facilitate signalling, but blocks may 
be used for other layout control and animation functions.</p>
<p>
If a block name is entered in the <b>Block: Name</b> field of the tool bar prior 
to adding a turnout, level crossing, or track segment, the added item is assigned 
to that block; if a sensor name (system name or user name) was entered into the
<b>Occupancy Sensor</b> field, that sensor will be assigned to the entered block. 
A turnout, level crossing, or track segment may also be assigned
to a block by entering that block's name in the edit dialog accessed by
selecting <b>Edit...</b> in that items popup menu. In either case, if a block 
with the entered name doesn't exist, one is created.</p>
<p>
A block name may be any series of alphabetic or numeric characters that describe 
the block, for example, "Red Main 2", "Lake Siding", or "Moose Block". Once a 
block is created, its name may not be changed; attempting to change a block's 
name will create a new block having the new name. After all items assigned to
the old block are changed to the new block, the block with the old name will
be automatically deleted (see below).</p>
<p>
Blocks may be viewed in the <b>Block Table</b>, that may be accessed using the 
<b>Tools</b> menu. Block information for a Layout Editor panel is kept in two 
parts, which are always linked together automatically. For each block, Layout 
Editor specific information is stored and managed in a Layout Editor specific 
part, and the generic part of the block information is stored in a JMRI Block. 
When a Layout Editor block is created, a corresponding JMRI Block is 
automatically created. The automatically created Block will have a system name 
<i>IBnnn</i> (where <i>nnn</i> is a number), and a user name the same as the 
block name mentioned above. It is the generic Blocks that are displayed in the 
Block Table. Avoid changing the user name in the Block Table, because this 
will break the link between the two parts of the block information.</p>
<p>
Of interest in the Block Table is the "Value" column. The "Value" can be used to 
identify trains as they move around the layout. If a train is parked in 
a Block, and train identifying text is manually entered into the "Value" entry 
for that Block, the text will be propogated from Block to Block as the train is 
run around the layout. When the train enters a Block, the text "Value" of the 
block the train entered from will be
copied into the "Value" of the entered Block; when the train exits a Block, the 
"Value" of the now empty block will be cleared. If a Memory Variable is assigned
to the block (see below), the "Value" of the Memory Variable will be set to the 
"Value" of the block. So by placing a Memory Icon near the block, the identity 
of the train in the block can be displayed in the Layout Editor panel. <b>Caution: 
Tracking trains using this method requires smoothly running block detection 
circuitry.</b> False or flikering block detection can easily confuse things.</p>
<p>
Turnout, level crossing, and track segment edit dialogs provide access to the 
Create/Edit Block dialog where information specific to a block may be entered
or edited. The <b>Occupancy Sensor:</b> field in the Create/Edit Block dialog 
shows the name of the occupancy sensor currently assigned to the block, if there
is one. To enter or change the occupancy sensor, enter the name (system name or
user name) of a sensor in the Sensor Table in the <b>Occupancy Sensor:</b> field. 
A sensor may be assigned as the occupancy sensor of only one block; attempting 
to do otherwise will result in an error message. Normally, the state of an 
occupancy sensor is "Active" when a block is occupied, so "Active" for occupied 
sense is the automatic default. This can be changed by selecting "Inactive" in 
the <b>Occupied Sense:</b> selection box.</p>
<p>
Block track colors are used instead of the default track color if a section of 
track is in a block. The track items in a block are drawn with different track 
colors for occupied and unoccupied states, allowing the track in a block to 
change color as a train enters and leaves that block. To set track colors, 
select the unoccupied track color in the <b>Track Color:</b> selection box, 
and select the occupied track color in the <b>Occupied Track Color:</b> 
selection box.</p>
<p>
The <b>Memory Variable Name:</b> field in the Create/Edit Block dialog 
shows the name of the memory variable currently assigned to the block, if there
is one. To enter or change the memory variable, enter the name (system name or
user name) of a memory variable in the Memory Table in the <b>Memory Variable 
Name:</b> field. Assigning a memory variable is optional. An assigned memory 
variable will contain as its "value" the "value" of the Block, and is useful 
in identifying trains as they are tracked around the layout (see above).
<p>
Since blocks are items on the physical layout, the same block may be used in 
more than one panel. Consequently, block information is saved in the non-
panel specific portion of the layout information, when panels are saved to a
file on disk.</p>
<p>
Blocks are deleted automatically when they are no longer used. Layout Editor 
keeps track of the number of track items (turnouts, track segments,
and level crossings) that are assigned to a block. This count is displayed in
the Create/Edit Block dialog as <b>Current Use Count:</b>. When panels are saved to
disk, only those blocks with a use count greater than zero are saved.</p>
