<H2>Edit Turnout
</H2>
<H3> Turnouts
</H3>
<P>
Layout Editor supports four different types of turnouts (track switches): right-
handed (<b>RH</b>), left-handed (<b>LH</b>), wye (<b>WYE</b>), and double 
crossover (<b>Double Xover</b>). The
other two types of turnouts sometimes used on model railroad layouts, double slip
and three-way, can be drawn using two LH or RH turnouts. Double slip turnouts, 
for example, are easily represented by two LH and/or RH turnouts drawn with their 
throats connected by a short track segment. Once a turnout has been created, its 
type cannot be changed. Changing the type of a turnout requires removing and 
recreating the turnout.</P>
<P>
<H3> Linking Turnout Drawings to Actual Turnouts
</H3></P>
Turnout drawings in a track diagram are drawn using solid lines for both 
continuing and diverging legs until the turnout drawings are linked to
turnouts in the Turnout Table. Once linked to actual turnouts, turnout 
drawings show the "known states" of the turnouts they represent. After linking,
you can toggle each turnout on your layout by clicking on the center point of its
drawing (provided <b>Allow Layout Control</b> is checked in the 
Options menu, and your DCC system supports computer control of turnouts). The
ability to toggle by clicking can be turned off by checking <b>Disabled</b> in 
the turnout's popup  menu.</P>
<P>
You can link each turnout drawing with an actual turnout (internal or hardware) 
in the Turnout Table as turnout drawings are created, by entering its Turnout 
Table name (either system name or user name) in the <b>Turnout: Name</b> field 
(top row of the tool bar) before clicking to create that turnout.  Alternatively, 
you can create your turnout drawings first, then select <b>Edit...</b> in each 
turnout's popup menu to open an <b>Edit Turnout</b> dialog that allows entry of 
the turnout name.</P>
<P>
<H3> Setting a Turnout's Block
</H3></P>
<P>
Optionally, you can designate which <b>Block</b> a turnout is in either by 
entering a block name in the <b>Block: Name</b> field of the tool bar prior to 
creating each turnout drawing, or by entering a block name in the Edit Turnout 
dialog at a later time. The Edit Turnout dialog also allows a Create/Edit Block 
dialog to be requested, where information for the turnout's block may be entered 
or changed. Blocks are discussed more fully on the help page of the Create/Edit 
Block dialog.</P>
<P>
<H3> Continuing Route Turnout State
</H3></P>
<p>
When a side track branches from a mainline track at an RH or LH turnout, the 
mainline normally continues through the turnout by following the straight-through 
track leg (the closed path). Sometimes, however, the mainline follows the 
diverging leg (the thrown path). To allow entry of this information, the Edit 
Turnout dialog contains an entry called <b>Continuing Route Turnout State</b>. 
Continuing Route Turnout State defaults to Closed when a turnout drawing is 
created. You should change it to Thrown if the mainline track follows the Thrown 
path through the turnout. For a WYE turnout, you should always check to see if 
its Continuing Route Turnout State is set correctly to reflect the path of the 
mainline. To test if Continuing Route Turnout State is correctly set, check the 
state of the turnout in the Turnout Table when the turnout is set to clear the 
mainline. The Turnout Table state should match the Continuing Route Turnout 
State chosen in the Edit Turnout dialog. Defining mainline track is 
optional; if you are not defining mainline track this item can be ignored.</p>
<P>
<H3> Double Crossover Turnouts
</H3></P>
<p>
Double crossover turnouts differ from other turnouts in several important ways. 
Like other turnouts, double crossovers have two states--crossed and straight. To
change a double crossover's state, however, requires four track switches to 
change in unison. This may be accomplished using one to four switch 
machines. Normally a double crossover is assigned a single turnout entry in the 
turnout table, but it may have several if its switch machines are controlled by
different stationary decoders. (You can use two JMRI Routes controlled by the 
same internal turnout to make multiple switch machines work together. In this 
case, enter the internal turnout as the turnout linked to the double crossover
turnout drawing.) With double crossovers, the crossover tracks are always 
considered side track, and any mainline track entering the turnout, leaves on 
the same straight as it entered. So there is no Continuing Route Turnout State 
entry in a double crossover's Edit dialog.</p> 
<p>
If you are defining blocks through double crossovers, note that double crossovers 
have four connecting points, each of which may be connected to a different track 
block. So parts of a double crossover may be in one, two, three, or four separate 
blocks. The Edit Turnout dialog for a double crossover allows the entry of up to 
four blocks, each linked to one of the four connection points. The first block 
entered must be the <b>Block: Name</b> field; this block is linked to upper left 
connection point (if the turnout has not been rotated), and serves as the 
default block for the double crossover. If any of <b>Block 2</b>, <b>Block 3</b>, 
or <b>Block 4</b> entries are blank, the default block is used. Block connection 
points are numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4, proceeding from the upper left connection 
point in a clockwise direction.</p>
