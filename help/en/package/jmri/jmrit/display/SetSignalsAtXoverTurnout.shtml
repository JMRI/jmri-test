<H2>Set Signals at Double Crossover
</H2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This tool provides an automated procedure for assigning signals to a double 
crossover turnout. If requested, this tool will place signal icons on the panel 
at the specified turnout, and will set up Simple Signal Logic for specified 
signal heads. Prior to selecting this tool, the turnout must be on the panel, 
and required signal heads must be in the Signal Table. This tool places signal 
heads only when the main track of the turnout is vertical or horizontal 
(or mostly vertical or horizontal) on the panel, so design your panel 
accordingly. The Simple Signal Logic created by this tool only works correctly 
if each of the track segments connected to the four connection points of the 
double crossover are assigned to different blocks.</p>
<p>
When this item is selected, a dialog is shown for entry of the turnout name 
(system or user), and the names of four to eight signal heads to be assigned 
to the turnout. Double crossover turnouts differ from other turnouts in several 
important ways. Like other turnouts, double crossovers have two states--crossed 
(Thrown) and straight (Closed). To change a double crossover's state, however, 
requires four track switches to change in unison. This may be accomplished 
using one to four switch machines. Normally a double crossover is assigned a 
single turnout entry in the turnout table, but it may have several if its 
switch machines are controlled by different stationary decoders. You can use 
two JMRI routes controlled by the same internal turnout to make multiple switch 
machines work together. In this case, enter the internal turnout as the turnout 
linked to the double crossover turnout drawing, and also enter it here.</p>

For each signal head, check boxes are available for selecting 
whether an icon is to be placed on the panel, and whether Simple Signal Logic 
is to be created for the signal head. Regardless of whether icons 
are placed or logic is created, Layout Editor will record that the entered 
signal heads are assigned to the specified turnout.</p>

<h3>The Set Signals at Double Crossover Dialog</h3>
<p>
In the <b>Turnout Name</b> field, enter the name (system or user) of the 
turnout to which the signal heads will be assigned. If the tool cannot find
the entered turnout on the panel, an error message results. If an internal 
turnout is used to control the double crossover (see above), enter its name 
in the <b>Turnout Name</b> field.</p> 
<p>
Signal Head names (either system or user) are entered in the next section. 
Entry of two signals at each corner of the double crossover turnout is 
provided for. The <b>Continuing</b> signal head at each corner is required, 
but the <b>Diverging</b> entries are optional. The corner labels, A, B, C, 
and D are as shown below for the case of all eight signal heads and the 
turnout in the straight through (Closed) position. (In the diagram
below, the double crossover turnout has not been rotated.)</p>

</p>
<p>
Similarly, the diagram below shows the four-signal-head case with the 
turnout in the crossover (Thrown) position. If you rotate the turnout, the 
corner labels rotate also.</p>

</p>
<p>
If signal heads at this double 
crossover turnout have been entered previously, click <b>Get Saved</b> to 
retrieve the signal head names previously entered.</p>
<p>
Any of the four corners may have either one or two signals, so all cases 
in between the two above are possible. If a signal head is entered 
for <b>Diverging</b>, then the <b>Continuing</b> head signals the straight through 
track and the <b>Diverging</b> head signals the crossover track. If no signal head 
is entered for <b>Diverging</b>, the <b>Continuing</b> signal head reflects
the state of whichever track the turnout is switched to. In that case, the
logic type for the <b>Continuing</b> signal head is 
<b>On Facing-Point Turnout</b>.</p>
<p>
If there was a signal head previously assigned to any 
position, and you enter a <i>different</i> signal head in the same place, 
the new signal head will replace the previous signal head, and the icon of
the previous signal head (if there was one) will be deleted from the 
panel. Similarly, if you replace a previously assigned <b>Diverging</b> signal 
head with a blank entry (no signal head), the previous entry is deleted and 
the double crossover will not have a signal head at that position. <b>If a signal 
head is changed, you must redo any logic that involves it.</b></p>
<p>
Check <b>Add Signal Icon to Panel</b> to request that an icon for a signal 
head be placed on the panel at the turnout position indicated. This tool 
can only place a signal icon on a turnout that is almost vertical or almost 
horizontal. If this is not so, a message is printed, and you should place 
the signal icon manually using the Layout Editor tool bar. Regardless, the 
signal head name is assigned to the specified  turnout position.</p>
<p>
Check <b>Set up Logic</b> to request that the tool set up a Simple 
Signal Logic for a signal head. The tool will create the logic and
automatically fill in entries from the information available. If
the tool does not have enough information available to set up the 
logic, a message results, and you will have to return later after 
more signals have been assigned to turnouts and block boundaries on the
panel.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
When setting up logic, this tool will follow track within 
a block until it finds a signal at the end of the block away from the 
turnout being signalled.  If your layout contains sections that are 
signalled and sections that are not, to get this tool to set up logic
correctly, you may have to place a virtual signal (a signal that does 
not correspond to an actual signal on the layout) at 
the unsignalled end of the block that connects a section of track that is 
signalled with track that is not signalled. If a block ends with an 
end bumper, no signal is required at the end bumper end.</p>
<p>
This tool sets up three-aspect signalling. With double crossovers, the 
crossover tracks are always considered side track, and any mainline track 
entering the turnout, leaves on the same straight as it entered. So, if
the double crossover is in the crossover state, limited speed (the least 
restrictive is not green, but yellow) is set up (see the four-turnout 
diagram above).</p>
<p>
If you have a special situation at a signal, you may have to edit the 
information entered by this tool into the Simple Signal Logic. If you 
would like four-aspect signalling, you can easily manually edit the logic 
to achieve this. Similarly, by simple hand edits of the logic, you can
add approach lighting. The Simple Signal Logic dialog can
be accessed from the popup menu of each signal icon. If your special 
situation cannot be handled by Simple Signal Logic, you should refer
to Logix to tailor the signal logic to your needs.</p>
<p>
<b>Please remember to save your panel after using this tool.</b></p>
