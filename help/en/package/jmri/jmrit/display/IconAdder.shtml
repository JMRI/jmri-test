<H1>The Icon Editors</H1>

<H2>Contents of the Icon Editors</H2>

<p>Five of the Icon Editors (Right Hand Turnout, Left Hand Turnout, Sensor, Signal, MultiSensor)
display a group of icons above a table.  The table lists all of the devices of the given type
that have been defined.  There is one icon for each state that the device can have.  The icons 
shown are the default icons, but you may change them.,/p>
<p>  Below the 
table are two buttons, <b>Add to Panel</b> and <b>Change Icon...</b>.  The Add to Panel button
is inactive until a device is selected from the table.  Then it becomes active, and when pressed
will install the set of icons into the panel.  Pressing the Change Icon button is discussed 
below.</p>  

<p>Two other Icon Editors, Memory Value and Reporter Value, have tables from which you must select
a device before the Add to Panel button becomes active.  No icons are displayed for these devices
because pressing Add to Panel installs the values maintained by these elements into the panel.</p>  

<p>Another two Icon Editors, Background Image and Icon (plain), display a default icon, but no
table, since these elements do not represent a JMRI device.  For these elements the Add to Panel
button is always active.</p>

<p>The remaining two choices for icons, RPS Reporter and Fast Clock, install their icons directly into the 
panel.</p>

<H2>Pressing the Change Icon Button</H2>

<p>Pressing this button will add a pane labeled <b>Catalog</b> to the window.  It will show
one or more trees in a scrollable panel.  Expanding the tree displays nodes that in turn
can be expanded.  The nodes correspond to entities that are file syetem directories or are
similar to file syetem directories.  Whenever image (icon) files are encountered in a node, 
the images are displayed in a pane below the Catalog tree(s).</p>

<p>This pane has a label that states how many image files have been found and the pane
displays them.  Beneath each image (icon) is a label that states the "scale" at which the 
image is displayed.  "Scale 1:1" indicates the icon is displayed at full size.  If a 
large image file had been found, the scale might be 0.25:1 to indicate that the display is
1/4 the actual size of the image that could be transferred to the Panel.  Below the icons
are some radio buttoon that allow you to adjust the background to the icons.  This may
help in determining what parts of the icon are opaque and what parts are transparent.</p>

<p>The Catalog pane will always display at least one tree titled "resourceJar".  This is
the resource directory within the jmri.jar from which you installed this current version of JMRI.
Other trees that you might see are: "preferenceDir", if you have created a "resources" 
directory within your JMRI preferences directory - or possibly, "imageIndex" if it has 
been created already (see below).</p>

<H3>Changing the Icon</H3>

<p>Most Icon Editor operations are done by "Drag and Drop".   To change an icon, 
drag any icon from the node display pane at the bottom 
of the window (i.e. press down on the mouse button and hold it down while moving the mouse) 
to any of the device icons at the top of the Icon 
Editor.  Release the mouse button after hovering over the icon you want to change and
the dragged icon will replace it.  You may go to other nodes and drag any of icons found there
until you are satisfied with the state icons you want to install into the Panel.</p>

<H2>Icon Editor Menus</H2>

<p>The <b>Find Icons</b> menu has the following items:
<UL>
        <LI><b>Create/Edit an ImageIndex Catalog</b>.  see the 
        <a href="package.jmri.jmrit.catalog.ImageIndex.shtml">Image Index Editor page</a>
        for how this menu item is used.</LI>
        
        <LI><b>Open a File System Directory</b>.  This opens a file chooser dialog where
        you may open any directory that that has image files.  To open the directory,
        select any image file contained in it and a window will attempt to display all 
        the image files found in the directory.
        <p>Depending on how much memory is needed to show all the files,
        two possible sequences of events that might follow.</p>
        <UL>
        <LI>If there is no difficulty in displaying the files, the window will show
        them along will the radio buttons to adjust their background.  And, two
        buttons will be displayed above the images - <b>Add to Catalog</b> and
        <b>Cancel</b>.  Pressing <b>Add to Catalog</b> will make this directory one
        of the trees in the Catalog pane.   In this case, you may then use it to
        select icons to change icons in any of the Icon Editors.  Pressing 
        <b>Cancel</b> will close the window with no further action.</LI>
        <LI>If there is not enough memory to display all the image files found in the
        directory, a message will state how many files can be displayed.  Press 
        <b>OK</b> and most likely another message will be posted explaining
        that if you want to add any of these images to the Catalog you should move
        or copy the ones you want to another directory.  Again press <b>OK</b>
        and the window will display what it can.  In this case, the two buttons 
        are <b>Show More</b> and <b>Cancel</b>.  Pressing <b>Show More</b> will
        display the next group of image files that it is able to display.  Again
        pressing <b>Cancel</b> will close the window with no further action.
        <p>Note that this is the case that generally occurs when you open 
        a photo album directory.</LI>
        </UL>
        
        <LI><b>Search File System for Icons</b>.  This item has you choose a drive
        on you computer to begin a search for icons.  It will visit every directory
        on the drive and when it encounters one with image files, it will open a 
        window and attempt to display all the images it finds there.  This may take
        some time.  As above, there may  not be enough memory to display all the files.
        The window that displays the images has three buttons: <b>Show More</b>, 
        <b>Continue Searching</b> and <b>Cancel</b>.
        <p>This is a feature to be used sparingly, but many interesting icons can
        be found, particularly those cached by your browser, for which you might 
        have a use.
</UL>        
      

<P>You can also create your own icons. Create a new folder named "resources" in
your JMRI Preferences directory. Add your new icons to that folder. This will prevent any
possible conflicts or loss of data during an upgrade. These new items will automatically 
appear under "preferenceDir" in the icon Catalog.</P>
