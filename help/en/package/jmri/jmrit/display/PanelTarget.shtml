<H2>The Panel</H2>

A panel is a set of icons representing various components of a layout.
Some of the icons available in JMRI include turnouts, signals, and
sensors. You can also include a background icon for your panel.

<H3>Panel operation</H3>
Clicking on a turnout symbol flips it from closed to thrown and
vice-versa. A turnout also has "unknown" and "inconsistent" states,
represented by an icon with a question mark and X respectively. These
represent a state where no information has been received, and where the
information is internally inconsistent (e.g. both closed and thrown at
the same time).
<P>This control can be used in various ways. For example, you could
have a turnout icon covering a turnout on a schematic diagram. When you
click on it, the turnout on the layout would be commanded to change, and
the track diagram would show which way a train would be routed. Or you
could use icons that show a lever to the right or left, and create a
panel that looks like a traditional US&S panel.</P>
<P>"Sensors" can be used to represent occupancy indicators or other
inputs. The default icon is a small circle, with color used to represent
the state of the sensor. These respond to changes on the layout
automatically. Clicking on a sensor causes the sensor to alternate
between "active" and "inactive" states. With the default icons, active
is a green circle and inactive is an empty circle. These are meant to
represent a lit/dark panel indicator. A red circle represents the
"unknown" state, used when no information has yet been received from the
layout.</P>
<H3>Creating a panel</H3>
These are made with a
<A HREF="PanelEditor.shtml"> Panel Editor</A>
, which allows you to place images to represent turnouts, sensors (on
some systems) and trackwork.

<H3>Popup menus</H3>

If the "Panel items popup menu active" box is checked in the Panel
Editor, a small popup menu will appear when you right click an icon.
Most icons allow you to rotate and remove the icon. There are other
options depending on the type of icon, for example, you can disable a
turnout so it doesn't actually control anything.

<P>The popup menu may also change if the configuration of an item is
changed. For example, if you add feedback to a turnout, the popup menu
includes a new item choice called "Tristate". Tristate allows you to use
the inconsistent icon, which is one of the four possible icons available
for a turnout. Normally when you first click on a turnout icon it
commands the layout to change the state of the turnout. If you use
feedback for a particular turnout, the icon display will wait to hear
from the layout before modifying the turnout icon to the closed or
thrown icon. By using Tristate, the icon will change immediately to the
inconsistent icon when the turnout is clicked. Inconsistent in this case
means that I've commanded the turnout to change and now we're waiting to
hear if it actually happened. If and when the layout returns the actual
or "known state" of the turnout, the icon will change to that state. If
you don't use Tristate, when you click on the icon, it may take some
time (milliseconds to seconds depending on the system) before the icon
responds with the known state of the turnout.</P>

<H3>Marker</H3>

The panel menu includes an item called "Marker". You can use a marker to
represent a locomotive or other device on your panel. You can move the
marker around the panel to show the locomotive's current position.
Markers are always moveable, and their popup menus are always active. To
create a marker, select "Add loco" or "Add loco from roster" from the
"Marker" menu. The "Add loco from roster" will use the road number from
your roster file as the label; if the road number wasn't entered when
you created your roster, the program will display the DCC address of the
loco. To remove markers from your panel, use the "Remove markers" menu
item.
<P>The marker's popup menu allows you to change the marker's color,
font size, style, and color. The menu also allows you to remove the
marker from the panel.

<P>If you want to keep your markers between operating sesssions, you
can save the panel and the markers will be saved to your panel file.
