<H1>Circuit Builder</H1>

<b>The Circuit Builder</b> is a view of a <b>Control Panel Editor</b>  
panel used to create track circuits that are implemented in JMRI by 
OBlocks, Portals and OPaths. The
prototype name for track having a device that can detect occupancy is
<b>Track Circuit</b>.  In JMRI we have misused the term <i>"Block"</i> and
<i>"OBlock"</i> to refer to what in the prototype world is a track circuit.
The term <b>Block</b> in the prototype world is <i>a length of track defined
by limits, whose use is governed by block signals, cab signals or block limit 
markers and train orders.</i>
</p>
<p>Circuit Builder is an alternative to using the Occupancy Block Tables.
OBlocks, Portals and OPaths are created and linked by "point and click" to
your layout diagram or panel.  Panel files previously made with Panel Editor
can be used with Circuit Builder as long as they can be loaded into JMRI
version 2.11.5 or later.  Circuit Builder will upgrade the track icons to
Indicator Track icons.  See <A HREF="ItemPalette.shtml"> The Item Palette</A>
for information about indicator track icons.
</p>

 
<H3>Mouse Operations</H3>
Circuit Builder has different mouse click conventions from those of the panel editors.
It does share some operations with them but it is not a tool for creating
panels.  Note the following:
<ul>
<li>Dragging is not permitted. (except in a few specific instances)</li>
<li>Popup menus for any panel item can only be activated in the basic window frame.</li>
<li>Editing is done on the window frames activated under the "Add/Edit Circuits" menu.</li>
<li>When editing, only track icons can be selected.  The selection color is a shade of blue
to diferentiate its selection from the basic editing mode.</li>
</ul> 

<H2>The Menus</H2>
   
<H3>The File Menu</H3>
The only menu item returns the view to the Control Panel Editor</P>

<H3>The Options Menu</H3>

<H3>The Add/Edit Circuits Menu</H3>

<H3>The Error Check Menu</H3>
