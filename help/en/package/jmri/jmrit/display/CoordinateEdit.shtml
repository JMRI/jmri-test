<H1>The Coordinate Editor</H1>

This editor allows you move an icon by setting its x and y 
coordinates. There are two text boxes where you can optionally enter the
x and y coordinates that you desire and by pressing the "Set" button the
icon will move to that location. If you wish to return the icon to its
original location when the editor was opened, press the "Cancel" button
and the editor will move the icon back to its original position and
close the editor window.

<P>You can also move an icon relative to its current position by
entering + or - and the number of pixels you wish it to move. For
example, entering +5 in the x coordinate box and pressing "Set" will
move the icon 5 pixels to the right. Entering -10 in the y coordinate
box and pressing "Set" will move an icon up 10 pixels. The editor will
also accept just + and - in the text box if you want to move the icon
one pixel.</P>

<P>This editor also allows you to set the level at which the icon is 
displayed.  The levels range from 1 to 10, with 10 being the top layer.
Use the level setting to place one icon above another to get the view
you want on your panel.
