<H1>The Item Palette</H1>

<b>The Item Palette</b> is used to place icons and text onto <b>Control Panel Editor</b>  
panels.  The palette is a tabbed window with tabs for each item type.  The common method 
all items use to add an item to a panel is "Drag and Drop".  Each tab has a bordered 
panel labeled <b>Drag to Panel</b>.  Drag the item inside the border to the panel.  It some
cases, you may have to make a selection before dragging - e.g. select a row from a table
or enter text into a field and press the enter key.</p>

<H2>Iconic Items</H2>
For those items using icons, multiple sets of icons are offered by the Item Palette.
In each of these cases several icon sets are provided by default.  Radio buttons
are used to select an icon set. The <b>Show Icons</b>
button displays all the icons in the set.  The <b>Edit Icons</b> button opens a dialog
where the icons may be changed by dragging new icons from the icon catalog.</p>
   
<H3>New Icon Sets</H3>
Icon sets may 
be added or deleted.  There is no limit on the number of additional icon sets that
can be added to an item tab.  When the Item Palette is customized with other icon
sets, the Item Palette is stored in the CatalogTrees.xml file in the preferences 
directory.<\p>
<p>
The <b>Edit Icons</b> dialog
is used to delete the icon set or to add an additional icon set.  When the
<b>Add New Icon Set</b> button is pressed, the currently selected icon set is saved and 
an icon set with "unknown" icons is displayed.  Change these icons by dragging icons from 
the icon catalog and be sure to name the new icon set in the text field at the top of the 
dialog.  Finally, press the <b>Create Icon Set</b> button and the dialog is closed with 
the new icon set added to radio button list.</p>


<H2>Tabled Items</H2>
The items associated with a table have an <b>Add New Table Item</b> button.
