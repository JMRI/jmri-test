<H2>Edit Turntable
</H2>

<p>
A Layout Editor turntable is a schematic representation of a turntable on the 
layout. A turntable is drawn as a circle with a variable number of track 
connections, called <i>ray tracks</i>. Each <i>ray track</i> is drawn 
as a short stub track radiating from the turntable circle. A track segment 
should connect to each ray track. Most of these track segments will connect 
a ray track to an end bumper. The distance of each ray track connection point 
from the turntable circle is fixed, but the direction of each ray track may be
varied by dragging its connection point around the turntable circle. Any 
number of turntables may be added to a panel, and each turntable may have 
any number of ray tracks.</p>
<p>
A turntable is added to a panel by selecting <b>Add Turntable</b> in the 
panel's Option menu. New turntables are placed at the center of the 
panel, and should be moved to desired locations by dragging its center 
point with the meta key pressed (right button drag on Windows). When a 
turntable is added, it has four ray tracks located in up, down, left, and
right directions. The turntable's popup menu has two items. Selecting
<b>Edit...</b> brings up an Edit Turntable dialog, and selecting <b>Remove</b> 
deletes the turntable and any track segments connected to it. Before a 
turntable is actually deleted, the program asks for verification of that
action.</p>
<p>
The Edit Turntable dialog allows the radius of the turntable circle to be 
changed, and provides for the addition and deletion of ray tracks. If 
<b>Turntable Radius</b> is changed, the new radius is used after <b>Done</b> 
is clicked.</p>
<p>
Ray tracks are identified by their angle. Ray track angles are measured from
the vertical in a clockwise direction. So, thinking of an analog clock, an
angle of 0 degrees is exactly vertical (the 12 o'clock position). Similarly 
an angle of 90 degrees corresponds to the 3 o'clock position, 180 degrees to 
6 o'clock, 270 degrees to 9 o'clock, and so on. Angles are always entered in 
degrees.</p>
<p> 
To add a ray track, enter the angle corresponding to it's desired position in 
<b>Ray Track Angle</b>, and click <b>New Ray Track</b>. The turntable shows 
the new ray track immediately. To delete a ray track, enter an angle close to 
its current position in <b>Ray Track Angle</b>, and click <b>Delete Ray 
Track</b>. The ray track, and any connected track segment are immediately 
deleted from the panel. The ray track that is deleted is the one that is 
closest to the entered angle. If no ray track is within 30 degrees of the 
entered angle, an error message results, and no ray track is deleted.
<b>Caution: There is no undo for these operations.</b></p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> An easy procedure is possible for accurately aligning ray track 
connection points and end bumpers so that each track segment extends through 
the center of the turntable. After positioning the center of the turntable, and 
after adding ray tracks where needed, expand the radius of the turntable by 
a factor of three to four. Then add end bumpers adjacent to (or on top of) each 
ray track connection point. After shrinking the radius back to its final 
radius, add track segments. Track segments will be aligned fairly 
precisely to the turntable center.</p>
