<H2>The Panel</H2>

A panel is a set of icons representing various components of a layout.
Some of the icons available in JMRI include turnouts, signals, and
sensors. You can also include a background icon for your panel.

<H3>Panel operation</H3>
Clicking on a turnout symbol flips it from closed to thrown and
vice-versa. A turnout also has "unknown" and "inconsistent" states,
represented by an icon with a question mark and X respectively. These
represent a state where no information has been received, and where the
information is internally inconsistent (e.g. both closed and thrown at
the same time).
<P>This control can be used in various ways. For example, you could
have a turnout icon covering a turnout on a schematic diagram. When you
click on it, the turnout on the layout would be commanded to change, and
the track diagram would show which way a train would be routed. Or you
could use icons that show a lever to the right or left, and create a
panel that looks like a traditional US&S panel.</P>
<P>"Sensors" can be used to represent occupancy indicators or other
inputs. The default icon is a small circle, with color used to represent
the state of the sensor. These respond to changes on the layout
automatically. Clicking on a sensor causes the sensor to alternate
between "active" and "inactive" states. With the default icons, active
is a green circle and inactive is an empty circle. These are meant to
represent a lit/dark panel indicator. A red circle represents the
"unknown" state, used when no information has yet been received from the
layout.</P>
<H3>Creating a panel</H3>
These are made with a

, which allows you to place images to represent turnouts, sensors (on
some systems) and trackwork.
