<dt class="left"><a name="intro"><H3>Introduction to Layout Editor Panels
</H3></a></dt>
<P>
<b>Layout Editor</b> supports the construction and display of PanelPro panels.
<b>Layout Editor</b> is similar to the traditional PanelPro <b>Panel Editor</b>, 
except it supports a drawn track diagram instead of an icon-based track
diagram.  Because of the way it works, <b>Layout Editor</b> captures the
full connectivity of your layout as you draw it. Several automated tools are 
available to make setting up your panel easier.</P>
<P>
<b>Layout Editor</b> is implemented using a tool bar at the top of your panel.  
This tool bar may be switched on and off using the <b>Edit Mode</b> item in 
your panel's <b>Options</b> menu. When you create a new Layout Editor panel, your 
new panel appears with the Edit Mode tool bar displayed at the top of your
panel, and with a system-specific help bar displayed at the bottom of the panel.
The help bar describes how to use the <b>Layout Editor</b> user interface. The 
help bar probably should be turned off (using the Options menu) once you are
familiar with the user interface.</P>
<P>
<b>Layout Editor</b> supports several options that you may or may not elect to use 
when you draw your track diagram. Sections of track may be designated as 
<i>mainline track</i> to differentiate it from <i>side track</i> (the default). 
Mainline track and side track may be drawn with different width lines. You may 
divide your layout into <i>blocks</i>, with each block having an occupancy 
sensor and each drawn with different track colors for occupied and unoccupied 
states, allowing the track in a block to change color as a train enters
and leaves that block. Normally track segments are drawn as solid lines, but you
can designate chosen segments as <i>dashed</i> to show tunnels or tracks crossing 
at different grades. You can also designate a track segment as 
<i>hidden</i> so it is displayed only when the tool bar is shown. These options may
be set up as you draw your panel, or you may add them later.</P>
<p>
JMRI supports multiple panels, either Layout Editor type or Panel Editor type. All
panels that have been created or loaded are listed in the submenu of <b>Show 
Panel</b> in the Panels menu. You can minimize or close a panel window, and bring
it back as the front most window by selecting it in this submenu. Multiple monitors 
are supported to the extent that the operating system allows, and a single panel 
may be stretched to occupy more than one monitor.</p>

<a name="start"><H3>Getting Started with Layout Editor
</H3></a>
<P>
To get familiar with the Layout Editor user interface, try the following:</P>
<P>
1. Select <b>New panel...</b> in the Panels menu, and click <b>Layout Editor</b>
in the dialog that is displayed.  You should see a blank panel window with
a tool bar at the top, and a help bar at the bottom. </P>
<P>
2. Move the cursor around inside the blank panel. Note that as you move, coordinates
are displayed at the upper left of the tool bar--<i>x</i> (horizontal) and <i>y</i> 
(vertical). (This is to aid in aligning items as you draw them.) Move the cursor over
the check boxes and entry fields in the tool bar, noting that each has a tool tip.</P>
<P>
3. To add a right-handed turnout, first, check RH for Turnout Type in the top row of 
the tool bar. Then, while depressing the shift key, click the mouse (left click on 
a two-button mouse) on a point about one third down and one third across from the upper 
left of your panel. A right-handed turnout should appear. The three red squares at the 
ends of the throat and the continuing and diverging legs of the turnout are connection 
points for <b>Track Segments</b>. The round circle at the center of the turnout is 
where you should point to get the turnout's popup menu.</P>
<P>
4. To add a left-handed turnout, first, check LH for turnout type. (Note that the
check is automatically turned off at RH.)  Type "180" in the Rotation box at the 
upper right of the tool bar, to rotate the new turnout. While pressing the shift
key, click the mouse on a point at the same height as the other turnout, but to 
the right about two or three inches. A left-handed turnout should appear with its
throat facing away from the right-handed turnout.</P>
<P>
5. To add track segments to connect the two turnouts, check Track Segment on the 
second row of the tool bar. While holding the shift key down the whole time, depress
the mouse button on the diverging connection point of one turnout, and drag to the 
diverging connection point of the other turnout, and release the mouse button when 
the cursor changes shape. You should see a track segment connecting the two turnouts, 
and both connection points should change color to green, indicating they are 
<i>full</i>, that is they have the maximum number of connections allowed. Similarly 
press and drag with shift pressed to add a track segment connecting the continuing 
legs of the two turnouts. You've drawn a passing siding.</P>
<P>
6. To add a turnout for an industry siding, check LH for a left-handed turnout, and
enter 0 in Rotation. Then with shift pressed, click on a point a couple of inches 
below and slightly to the right of the turnout on your left.</P>
<P>
7. To connect this turnout with the upper passing track and form a simple oval track
diagram, check Anchor Point on the third row of the tool bar. An <b>Anchor Point</b>
is a node in a track diagram that can accept two connecting track segments; it's used 
to place connected track segments so that they look reasonably nice (and also to divide
blocks). While holding shift down, click on a point exactly to the left of the turnout 
on your upper left, and again on a point directly below this one, but exactly to the
left of the lower turnout. Next click on a point about 1/2 inch to the left and 1/2
inch below the upper anchor point, and again on a point 1/2 inch to the left and 
1/2 inch above the lower anchor point.  You should now have four anchor points 
outlining the left side of the oval.  Connect these four points and the turnout 
throat connection points with track segments--check Track Segment, then with shift 
pressed, click and drag to create each of the five track segments needed.  Note that 
the anchor point rectangle will change from red to green when it has two connections.
Similarly repeat this procedure to draw the right side of the oval.</P>
<P>
8. Turnout positions and anchor point positions may be adjusted to make the track 
diagram look nice by holding down the meta key (check the help bar to see which key
is the meta key), and dragging each anchor point or turnout. To adjust the position 
of a turnout, drag the center point of the turnout with the meta key pressed.</P>
<P>
9. Next complete the industry siding. The diverging connection point of the lower 
turnout should be the only box needing a connection (colored red). Check End Bumper 
in the tool bar. An <b>End Bumper</b> is a node in a track diagram that can accept 
only one connection. With shift pressed, click on a point exactly to the right of 
the diverging connection point of the lower turnout. Connect your end bumper to the 
diverging connection point by holding shift down, while pressing the mouse 
button on the diverging connection point and dragging to the end bumper. Your track
diagram should look like the following:</P>
<p>
<A href="./images/OvalLayoutEditMode.gif"><IMG SRC="./images/OvalLayoutEditMode.gif" 
ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="563" HEIGHT="169" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0"></A>
<P>
10. Select <b>Edit Mode</b> in the Options menu to hide the tool bar (and the 
help bar) and see how your track diagram of a simple oval layout would look in a 
final panel. You should see connection points and edit circles disappear.</P>
<P>
The above steps demonstrated the basic steps needed to draw a track diagram. You can
clear this demonstration panel by selecting <b>Delete this panel...</b> in the panel's
File menu, and begin to construct a track diagram of your layout. Read the items
below to learn more about how to add content to track diagram items and how to add
icon items to your panel.</P>
<p>
<b>Note: Layout Editor tools for placing signal heads and automatically configuring
signal logic require that turnouts and block boundaries (see below) be oriented 
vertically or horizontally on your panel.</b> To make maximum use of these tools, design 
your panel with turnouts oriented vertically or horizontally (the orientation does 
not have to be exact, just mostly vertical or mostly horizontal).</p>

<a name="toolbar"><h3>Using the  Layout Editor Tool Bar
</h3></a>
<p>
The tool bar is used to add items to a panel, and to provide information for the items
added. The item to be added is selected using one of the following checkboxes in the tool 
bar:</p>
<p><ul>
	<li><b>RH</b> - selects a right-handed turnout</li>
	<li><b>LH</b> - selects a left-handed turnout</li>
	<li><b>WYE</b> - selects a wye turnout</li>
	<li><b>Double Xover</b> - selects a double crossover turnout</li>
	<li><b>RH Xover</b> - selects a right-handed single crossover turnout</li>
	<li><b>LH Xover</b> - selects a left-handed single crossover turnout</li>	
	<li><b>Level Crossing</b> - selects a level crossing track (a  diamond)</li>
	<li><b>Track Segment</b> - selects a piece of straight track</li>
	<li><b>End Bumper</b> - selects a connection point at the end of a track</li>
	<li><b>Anchor Point</b> - selects a connection point between two track segments</li>
	<li><b>Text Label</b> - selects a label showing the content of the entry field </li>
	<li><b>Memory Label</b> - selects a label showing the contents of the memory whose name is 
	entered on the right</li>
	<li><b>Multi-sensor</b> - selects a multi-sensor--A dialog is displayed allowing the 
	multi-sensor to be defined. Before creating the multi-sensor, a name must be entered 
	for every sensor to define the multi-sensor completely.</li>
	<li><b>Sensor Icon</b> - selects a sensor icon showing the sensor whose name is entered on
	 the right.</li>
	<li><b>Signal Icon</b> - selects a signal head icon showing the signal head whose name is 
	entered on the right</li>
	<li><b>Icon Label</b> - selects a general purpose icon</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
The top ten items are used to create a track diagram, and are new with Layout Editor.
The remaining six items are icon-based and are similar to corresponding icon items in 
Panel Editor.</p>
<p>
To add all items except Track Segment:
</p>
<p><ol>
	<li>Select its check box (check boxes of the other items will automatically be 
	deselected).</li>
	<li>Enter any other information needed (see below).</li>
	<li>Move the mouse cursor to the point on the panel where you would like the item to 
	appear.</li>
	<li>Hold down the shift key.</li>
	<li>Click the mouse (left-click).</li>
	<li>Release the mouse, and then release the shift key.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>
A Track Segment is a piece of straight track connecting two connection points (red 
squares on a turnout, anchor point, end bumper, or level crossing).  Before you can
add a Track Segment, two red connection points must be visible on the panel. To add 
a Track Segment connecting two red connection points:
</p>
<p><ol>
	<li>Select the Track Segment check box in the tool bar.</li>
	<li>Enter any other information--all optional (see below).</li>
	<li>Hold down the shift key.</li>
	<li>Press and hold down the mouse on either of the connection points.</li>
	<li>Drag the mouse to the other connection point. The cursor shape changes 
	when you're there.</li>
	<li>Release the mouse, and then release the shift key.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>
Check boxes and fields on the tool bar other than the fourteen enumerated above 
are for entering information that will be applied to created items as they are
created. Some information is required, and some is optional. Optional things may 
be added or changed later using an item's popup menu, but it's sometimes easier 
to add them as items are created. Required items are tightly linked to created 
items and may not be changed later without removing and recreating the item. Each 
information entry has a tool tip that explains what it does; hover the mouse 
cursor over a field or check box to see its tool tip. Information entries are 
described below, along with which created items they apply to and whether they 
are optional or required.
</p>
<p><ul>
	<li><b>Turnout: Name</b> (field) - applies to RH, LH, WYE, Double Xover, 
	RH Xover, LH Xover - Entry is optional. If a name is entered, it must 
	correspond to a turnout in the Turnout Table.</li>
	<li><b>Rotation</b> (field) - applies to RH, LH, WYE, Double Xover, RH Xover, 
	LH Xover - Entry is optional. If there is no entry, the turnout is not rotated 
	when it is created. Remember to try to keep your turnouts oriented vertically 
	or horizontally.</li>
	<li><b>Block: Name</b> (field) - applies to RH, LH, WYE, Double Xover, RH Xover, 
	LH Xover, Track Segment, Level Crossing - Entry is optional. If a name is entered, 
	the created item is assigned to the named block. If a name is entered and that block 
	does not exist, a new block with that name is created. A block name may be any 
	alphabetic or numeric characters that identify the block.</li>
	<li><b>Occupancy Sensor</b> (field) - applies to the block named in the above 
	entry - Entry is optional. An entry must correspond to a sensor in the Sensor 
	Table. If the named block already has an occupancy sensor, this sensor replaces
	the previous occupancy sensor.</li>
	<li><b>Dashed</b> (check box) - applies to Track Segment - A Track Segment may
	be drawn as a solid line or a dashed line. Solid is the default if Dashed is 
	not checked. Dashed is useful for tunnels or tracks crossing at different
	grade levels.</li>
	<li><b>Mainline</b> (check box) - applies to Track Segment - A Track Segment
	may be either <i>mainline track</i> or <i>side track</i>. Side track is the 
	default if Mainline is not checked. Designating some of your track as 
	<i>mainline track</i> is optional.</li>
	<li><b>Text Label</b> (field) - applies to Text Label - Entry is required if 
	anything is to be displayed in the new Text Label.</li>
	<li><b>Memory Label</b> (field) - applies to Memory Label - Entry is required.  
	If the entered name doesn't correspond to a memory variable in the Memory Table, 
	a new memory variable will be created, using the entered name as the JMRI 
	system name (with IM prefixed if needed).</li>
	<li><b>Sensor Icon</b> (field) - applies to Sensor Icon - Entry is required. 
	If a sensor with the entered name does not exist, it will be created using the 
	entered name as the JMRI system name (with a suitable prefix if needed).</li>
	<li><b>Signal Icon</b> (field) - applies to Signal Icon - Entry is required.
	If a signal head with the entered name is not in the Signal Table, an error 
	message results, and the Signal Icon is not created. <b>Note: To automatically 
	associate signal heads with turnouts and block boundaries, you should use the 
	automated tools in the Tools menu to place signal icons.</b> This item
	is provided for those cases where those automated tools cannot place a 
	signal icon where needed.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
When pressed, the <b>Change Icons...</b> button on the tool bar brings up an icon 
editor for either sensor icons, signal icons, or general purpose icons, depending 
upon whether <b>Sensor Icon</b>, <b>Signal Icon</b>, or <b>Icon Label</b> is 
checked. If none of these items is checked, the button press is ignored. For 
Signal Icons, Layout Editor defaults to the left-facing short icons found at 
"resources/icons/smallschematics/searchlights/". If you are using a black 
background you may need to switch to white icons that are available in the same
area, since the default icons have black borders.</p>

<a name="filemenu"><h3>Using a Panel's File Menu
</h3></a>
<p>
The File menu provides for storing and deleting panels. 
</p>
<p><ul>
	<li><b>Store panels...</b> - When this item is selected, a Save dialog is 
	shown. When Save is selected in the Save dialog, all layout configuration 
	information is written to disk, including information for all panels, both 
	Layout Editor type and Panel Editor type, and all non-panel specific layout 
	configuration items (e.g., turnouts, sensors, lights, signal heads, routes, 
	logixs, blocks, etc.) <b>Store panels...</b> is available in the File 
	menu of each panel, and in the Panels menu. It can also be reached by 
	selecting <b>Store Configuration And Panels To File...</b> in the Store 
	submenu of the File menu of any table.</li>
	<li><b>Delete this panel...</b> - This item deletes the front most panel. A 
	confirmation dialog is displayed, allowing the choice of canceling before
	deleting. Deletion removes the panel from the program. To permanently delete 
	a panel from your panel file, <b>Store panels...</b> must be selected after 
	deleting that panel. <b>There is no undo for deletion.</b> Unless the panel has 
	been saved to disk, it is gone after deletion.</li>
</ul></p>


<a name="option"><h3>Using Layout Editor's Options Menu</h3></a>
<p>
The Options menu is used to set options, add items to the panel, and perform
operations that do not happen very often during panel creation. Each Option menu 
selection is described below.
</p>
<p><ul>
	<li><b>Edit Mode</b> - When this item is checked, the tool bar is displayed 
	at the top of the panel, and the track diagram displays connection points and
	edit circles. Uncheck Edit Mode to hide the tool bar and the help bar if it 
	is displayed.</li>
	<li><b>Allow Repositioning</b> - When this item is checked, items on the panel
	can be repositioned by dragging on the item with the meta key pressed. Track
	diagram items can only be repositioned when Edit Mode is checked, but icon-
	based items can be repositioned any time this item is checked.</li>
	<li><b>Allow Layout Control</b> - When this item is checked, clicking on 
	active turnout items in the track diagram or on active icon items, such as
	sensor icons, and signal icons, will toggle the state of the represented 
	item.</li>
	<li><b>Allow Turnout Animation</b> - When this item is checked, turnouts 
	on the track diagram will change to show turnout state. If this item is 
	not checked, turnout drawings will show the Closed position at all times.
	</li>
	<li><b>Show Help Bar in Edit Mode</b> - If this item is checked, the help 
	bar is displayed when the tool bar is displayed.</li>
	<li><b>Show Grid in Edit Mode</b> - If this item is checked, a background 
	grid is displayed in edit  mode. This is a temporary item. When a panel is 
	loaded, it is automatically unchecked.</li>
	<li><b>New Title...</b> - Selecting this item brings up a small window that 
	allows a new panel window title to be entered.</li>
	<li><b>Add Background Image...</b> - Selecting this item shows a dialog
	that allows a background image to be added to the panel. See 
	<a href="#background">Backgrounds</a> below for more information.</li>
	<li><b>Add Fast Clock</b> - Selecting this item adds an analog fast clock 
	at the upper left. You can then drag it with the meta key pressed to any 
	location on the panel.</li>
	<li><b>Add Turntable</b> - Selecting this item adds a turntable to the 
	panel at the center of the panel. You can then drag it with the meta key 
	pressed to any location on the panel.</li>
	<li><b>Save Location and Size</b> - When this item is selected, the current 
	panel window size and location replace the default size and location of the 
	panel window. If the panel is saved to disk after this item is selected, when 
	the panel is reloaded its window will have the size and location saved when 
	this item was selected, provided the computer operating system permits a 
	window with that size and location.</li>
	<li><b>Set Track Width...</b> - Selecting this item brings up a dialog that 
	allows entry of a width for mainline track and a width for side track. All 
	mainline track and all side track in the track diagram will use the new 
	values. (See below for more information on types of track.)</li>
	<li><b>Set Default Track Color</b> - This item's submenu allows one of 
	thirteen colors to be selected as the default track color. If a part of the 
	track is in a block, the color set by the block is used instead of the default
	track color when drawing that track.</li>
</ul></p>

<a name="toolsmenu"><h3>Using Layout Editor's Tools Menu
</h3></a>
<p>
The Tools menu provides tools to aid in creation and editing of Layout Editor
panels. Using these automated procedures should reduce the time and effort needed
to create your panel. Note: <b>Set Signals</b> tools only work correctly if 
turnouts and block boundaries are oriented mostly vertically or mostly horizontally.
</p>
<p><ul>
	<li><b>Scale/Translate Track Diagram...</b> - Selecting this item brings up 
	a dialog that allows scaling and translation of the track diagram. (For more 
	information on this item, see the help page for that dialog.)</li>
	<li><b>Translate Selection...</b> - Prior to selecting this item, the user 
	must select an area on the panel. To select an area, press the mouse button
	(left button) with the cursor at the upper left of the area, and drag to the
	lower right of the area. With a selection active, selecting this item brings up 
	a dialog that allows translation of the selected area. (For more 
	information on this item, see the help page for that dialog.)</li>
	<li><b>Undo Translate Selection</b> - Selecting this item automatically 
	reverses the previous <b>Translate Selection...</b>. Only one level of undo
	is supported. If a selection has not been translated, this item is ignored.</li>
	<li><b>Set Signals at Turnout...</b> - This item provides an automated 
	procedure for assigning signals to a turnout. Right-handed turnouts, 
	left-handed turnouts, and wye turnouts are supported. Prior to accessing this 
	item, the turnout must be on the panel, and the required signal heads 
	must be in the Signal Table. When this item is selected, a dialog is 
	shown for entry of the turnout name (system or user), and the names of the 
	three or four signal heads to be placed around the turnout. For each signal
	head, check boxes are available for selecting whether an icon is to be placed 
	on the panel, and whether Simple Signal Logic is to be created for the 
	signal head. Regardless of whether icons are placed or logic is created, 
	Layout Editor will record that the entered signal heads are assigned to 
	the entered turnout. This tool may not have enough information to create
	logic when it is first invoked, so you may have to return to it later after
	all signals have been assigned and after blocks have been defined for 
	signaled regions of track on the panel. After a turnout has been assigned to 
	the turnout drawing, this tool can be reached by selecting <b>Set Signals...</b> 
	in that turnout's popup menu. (For more information, see the help page for the 
	Set Signals at Turnout dialog.)</li>
	<li><b>Set Signals at Block Boundary...</b> - This item provides an automated
	procedure for assigning signals to a block boundary not associated with a 
	turnout or a level crossing. Prior to accessing this item, blocks must 
	be defined for signaled
	regions of track on the panel, and the required signal heads must be in the
	Signal Table. When this item is selected, a dialog is shown for entry of  
	names of the two blocks whose boundary is to be signaled, and for entry of
	names (system or user) of one or two signal heads to be assigned to the 
	block boundary. For each signal head, check boxes are available for 
	selecting whether an icon is to be placed on the panel, and whether Simple 
	Signal Logic is to be created for the signal head. Regardless of whether icons 
	are placed or logic is created, Layout Editor will record that the entered 
	signal heads are assigned to the specified block boundary. If create logic 
	is requested and the tool does not have enough information available to 
	set up the logic, you may have to return later after more signals have 
	been assigned. After an anchor point is recognized as a block boundary, 
	this tool can be reached by selecting <b>Set Signals...</b> in that anchor 
	point's popup menu. (For more information, see the help page for the Set Signals
	at Block Boundary dialog.)</li>
	<li><b>Set Signals at Crossover...</b> - This item provides an automated
	procedure for assigning signals at a crossover turnout. It also provides
	for placing signal heads around the crossover and for setting up logic
	for those signals. Prior to accessing this item, blocks must be defined for 
	signaled regions of track on the panel, and the required signal heads must be 
	in the Signal Table. When this item is selected, a small dialog is shown for 
	entry of the name (system or user) of the crossover turnout to be signaled. 
	The entered name must correspond to a double crossover, a right-handed crossover,
	or a left-handed crossover. (If this tool is accessed by selecting 
	<b>Set Signals...</b> in a turnout's popup menu, the turnout name is 
	entered automatically.) After the crossover turnout is identified, a dialog 
	is displayed for entry of names (system or user) of four to eight signal 
	heads to be assigned to the crossover. For each signal head, check boxes are 
	available for selecting whether an icon is to be placed on the panel, and 
	whether signal logic is to be created for the signal head. Regardless of 
	whether icons are placed or logic is created, Layout Editor will record that 
	the entered signal heads are assigned to the specified turnout. If create logic 
	is requested and the tool does not have enough information available to 
	set up the logic, you may have to return later after more signals have 
	been assigned. After a turnout from the Turnout Table is assigned to a 
	crossover, this tool can be reached by selecting <b>Set Signals...</b> 
	in that turnout's popup menu. (For more information, see the help page for the 
	Set Signals at Crossover dialog.)</li>
	<li><b>Set Signals at Level Crossing...</b> - This item provides an automated
	procedure for assigning signals at a level crossing (a diamond). It also provides
	for placing signal heads around the level crossing and for setting up logic
	for those signals. Prior to accessing this tool, blocks must be defined for 
	signaled regions of track on the panel, and the required signal heads must be 
	in the Signal Table. This tool works best if the level crossing also serves as 
	the boundary between two blocks in each signaled direction. When this item is 
	selected, a dialog is shown for entry of one or two block names that uniquely 
	identify the level crossing to be signaled, and for entry of
	names (system or user) of two or four signal heads to be arrayed around the 
	level crossing. For each signal head, check boxes are available for 
	selecting whether an icon is to be placed on the panel, and whether Simple 
	Signal Logic is to be created for the signal head. Regardless of whether icons 
	are placed or logic is created, Layout Editor will record that the entered 
	signal heads are assigned to the specified level crossing. If create logic 
	is requested and the tool does not have enough information available to 
	set up the logic, you may have to return later after more signals have 
	been assigned. After blocks have been assigned to the level crossing tracks, 
	this tool can be reached by selecting <b>Set Signals...</b> in that level 
	crossing's popup menu. (For more information, see the help page for the 
	Set Signals at Level Crossing dialog.)</li>
	<li><b>Set Signals at Throat-to-Throat Turnouts...</b> - This item provides an 
	automated procedure for assigning signals to two turnouts in close proximity 
	oriented throat-to-throat, with the throats connected by a single track segment.
	This arrangement is used where four tracks come together in a small area, so 
	closely that no signals are placed at the turnout throats. Such a setup is used 
	to model a double-slip turnout, for example, but can also occur in other contexts.
	Each of the two turnouts may be either right-hand (RH), left-hand (LH), or wye 
	(WYE) turnouts. This tool provides for placing signal heads at the continuing 
	and diverging tracks of the two turnouts.  It also provides for setting up logic
	for those signals. Prior to accessing this item, blocks must be defined for 
	signaled regions of track on the panel, and the required signal heads must be 
	in the Signal Table. When this item is selected, a dialog is shown for entry of  
	the names (system or user) of the two turnouts to be signaled, and for entry of
	names (system or user) of four to eight signal heads to be assigned. For 
	each signal head, check boxes are available for selecting whether a signal  
	head icon is to be placed on the panel, and whether signal logic 
	is to be created for the signal head. Regardless of whether icons 
	are placed or logic is created, Layout Editor will record that the entered 
	signal heads are assigned to the specified turnouts. If create logic 
	is requested and the tool does not have enough information available to 
	set up the logic, you may have to return later after more signals have 
	been assigned. This tool is invoked from the Tools menu only. It cannot be 
	reached a turnout's popup menu. (For more information, see the help page for 
	the Set Signals at Throat-to-Throat Turnouts dialog.)</li>
</ul></p>

<a name="editing"><h3>Editing and Removing Items
</h3></a>
<p>
Every item on a panel has a popup menu. To access the popup menu of an icon-based 
item (sensor icon, signal icon, text label, memory label, multi-sensor, fast clock,
icon label or background): on Windows systems, right-click on the icon; on Macintosh 
systems, control-click on the icon (hold down the control key and click the mouse 
button on any point within the icon). Drawn items are similar, except for where you 
click. For turnouts, level crossings, or track segments, control-click or right-click 
inside the circle at the center of the item. For anchor points or end bumpers, 
control-click or right-click inside the square showing the connection point.</p>
<p>
To delete an item from a panel, select <b>Remove</b> in that item's popup menu. 
Some items will show a verify dialog. Most verify dialogs have an option to shut
off verify dialogs in case you're deleting many of the same items.</p>
<p>
Some popup menus allow information relating to the item to be edited directly 
from the popup menu, for example, font size, style, and color options for text 
labels and text memory labels. The fast clock's popup menu allows stopping and 
starting the fast clock and changing its rate ratio. Icon-based popup menus show
the <i>x</i> (horizontal) and <i>y</i> (vertical) location of the icon on the 
panel. These coordinates give the location of the upper left corner of the icon. 
A convenient way to change the location of an icon-based item is to select 
<b>Set x & y</b> in its popup menu. Selecting <b>Set x & y</b> brings up a small 
window that provides for precise adjustment of the icon's position.</p>
<p>
With turnouts, level crossings, and track segments, selecting 
<b>Edit...</b> in the popup menu brings up a small window for editing. If a 
turnout has no connections, a <b>Rotate</b> item appears in its popup menu,
allowing the turnout to be rotated to any angle. More information on the edit
dialogs of turnouts, level crossings, and track segments is contained below in 
the discussion of these items, and in the help page of each edit dialog.</p>
<p>
A signal icon's popup menu allows editing of signal information related to the 
panel, but also contains an <b>Edit Logic...</b> item that brings up a window for 
editing Simple Signal Logic for the signal head (for more information on 
Simple Signal Logic, see that window's help). Simple Signal Logic supports ABS 
signaling, and will handle most of your signal logic needs. Refer to Logix for 
more complicated logic needs not handled by Simple Signal Logic.</p>
<p>
With turnouts, level crossings, and anchor points, most of Layout Editor's tools 
for assigning signal heads to these items, for automated placement of signal 
head icons on the panel, and for automated creation of signal logic for 
the assigned signal heads may be reached by selecting <b>Set Signals...</b> in
the popup menu. <b>Set Signals...</b> is not shown in the popup menu until a 
minimum amount of information is available to the tools. The remaining <b>Set 
Signals...</b> tools may be accessed via the Tools menu. These tools are briefly
described above under <a href="#toolsmenu">Using Layout Editor's Tools Menu</a>, 
and are discussed in detail on the help page of the tool's dialog window.</p>

<a name="turnouts"><H3>Turnouts
</H3></a>
<P>
Layout Editor supports six different types of turnouts (track switches): right-
handed (<b>RH</b>), left-handed (<b>LH</b>), wye (<b>WYE</b>), double 
crossover (<b>Double Xover</b>), right-handed single crossover (<b>RH Xover</b>). 
and left-handed single crossover (<b>LH Xover</b>). The
other two types of turnouts sometimes used on model railroad layouts, double slip
and three-way, can be drawn using two LH or RH turnouts. Double slip turnouts, 
for example, are easily represented by two LH and/or RH turnouts drawn with their 
throats connected by a short track segment. Once a turnout has been created, its 
type cannot be changed. Changing the type of a turnout requires removing and 
recreating the turnout. Drawn turnout parts may be lengthened, shortened, or 
repositioned by dragging connection points with the meta key pressed, and 
the entire turnout may be repositioned by dragging the center circle with the
meta key pressed.</P>
<P>
Turnout drawings in a track diagram are drawn using solid lines for both 
continuing and diverging legs until the turnout drawings are linked to
turnouts in the Turnout Table. Once linked to actual turnouts, turnout 
drawings show the "known states" of the turnouts they represent. After linking,
you can toggle each turnout on your layout by clicking on the center point of its
drawing (provided <b>Allow Layout Control</b> is checked in the 
Options menu, and your DCC system supports computer control of turnouts). The
ability to toggle by clicking can be turned off by checking <b>Disabled</b> in 
the turnout's popup  menu.</P>
<P>
You can link each turnout drawing with an actual turnout (internal or hardware) 
in the Turnout Table as turnout drawings are created, by entering its Turnout 
Table name (either system name or user name) in the <b>Turnout: Name</b> field 
(top row of the tool bar) before clicking to create that turnout.  Alternatively, 
you can create your turnout drawings first, then select <b>Edit...</b> in each 
turnout's popup menu to open an <b>Edit Turnout</b> dialog that allows entry of 
the turnout name. Once the name of an actual turnout is entered, the actual 
turnout can be toggled by clicking the mouse at the center of the turnout. 
Turnout toggling can be disabled by checking <b>Disabled</b> in the turnout's 
popup menu.</P>
<P>
Optionally, you can designate which <b>Block</b> a turnout is in either by 
entering a block name in the <b>Block: Name</b> field of the tool bar prior to 
creating each turnout drawing, or by entering a block name in the Edit Turnout 
dialog at a later time. The Edit Turnout dialog also allows an Edit Block dialog 
to be requested, where information for the turnout's block may be entered or 
changed. (Blocks are discussed more fully below.)</P>
<p>
When a side track branches from a mainline track at an RH or LH turnout, the 
mainline normally continues through the turnout by following the straight-through 
track leg (the closed path). Sometimes, however, the mainline follows the 
diverging leg (the thrown path). To allow entry of this information, the Edit 
Turnout dialog contains an entry called <b>Continuing Route Turnout State</b>. 
Continuing Route Turnout State defaults to Closed when a turnout drawing is 
created. You should change it to Thrown if the mainline track follows the Thrown 
path through the turnout. For a WYE turnout, you should always check to see if 
its Continuing Route Turnout State is set correctly to reflect the path of the 
mainline. To test if Continuing Route Turnout State is correctly set, check the 
state of the turnout in the Turnout Table when the turnout is set to clear the 
mainline. The Turnout Table state should match the Continuing Route Turnout 
State chosen in the Edit Turnout dialog. Defining mainline track is 
optional; if you are not defining mainline track this item can be ignored.</p>
<p>
Crossover turnouts differ from other turnouts in several important ways. 
Like other turnouts, crossovers have two states--crossed and straight. To
change a crossover's state, however, requires two or four track switches to 
change in unison. This may be accomplished using one to four switch 
machines. Normally a crossover is assigned a single turnout entry in the 
turnout table, but it may have several if its switch machines are controlled by
different stationary decoders. (You can use two JMRI Routes controlled by the 
same internal turnout to make multiple switch machines work together. In this 
case, enter the internal turnout as the turnout linked to the crossover
turnout drawing.) With crossovers, the crossover tracks are always 
considered side track, and any mainline track entering the turnout, leaves on 
the same straight as it entered. So there is no Continuing Route Turnout State 
entry in a crossover's Edit dialog.</p> 
<p>
If you are defining blocks through crossovers, note that crossovers 
have four connecting points, each of which may be connected to a different track 
block. So parts of a crossover may be in one, two, three, or four separate 
blocks. The Edit Turnout dialog for a crossover allows the entry of up to 
four blocks, each linked to one of the four connection points. The first block 
entered must be the <b>Block: Name</b> field; this block is linked to upper left 
connection point (if the turnout has not been rotated), and serves as the 
default block for the crossover. If any of <b>Block 2</b>, <b>Block 3</b>, 
or <b>Block 4</b> entries are blank, the default block is used. Block connection 
points are numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4, proceeding from the upper left connection 
point in a clockwise direction.</p>

<a name="track"><h3>Track Segments and Connection Points
</h3></a>
<P>
A <b>Track Segment</b> is a piece of straight track stretching between two
connection points. Connection points are drawn as small red or green squares.
Connection points are found on turnouts, anchor points, end bumpers, and 
level crossings. Each turnout has three or four connection points, 
each accepting one connection. Each anchor point has one connection point that 
can accept two connections. An end bumper is similar, but only accepts one
connection. Level crossings have four connection points, each accepting one
connection. A connection point that can accept a connecting track segment is 
drawn red.  When a connection point has its capacity of connections, its color 
is changed to green. When all connection points are green, a track diagram is
complete, with all connections defined.</P>
<P>
Track segments are normally drawn as solid lines. but you can designate that a
track segment be drawn <i>dashed</i> to show tunnels or tracks crossing 
at different grades. You can request a dashed line for a track segment by 
checking <b>Dashed</b> in the tool bar before the track segment is created, 
or you can change a track segment to <b>Dashed</b> in the Edit Track Segment
dialog. (More anchor points can be added to get the dashed part of your
track to cover the exact area desired.) You can also designate a track segment 
as <i>hidden</i> so it's displayed only when edit mode is active. <i>Hidden</i> 
track segments are useful for track diagrams drawn as multiple rows where the 
end of one row connects to the beginning of the same or another row. To make a 
track segment hidden, check <b>Hide Track</b> in the Edit Track Segment dialog.</P>
<p>
Optionally, track segments are used to designate <i>mainline track</i> or <i>side 
track</i>. The legs of turnouts and level crossings are set to <i>mainline 
track</i> or <i>side track</i> according to the designations of track segments 
that are connected to them. See the discussion of continuing routes in the 
above section on turnouts for information on how a mainline is tracked 
through a turnout.</p>
<p>
If <b>Mainline</b> is checked in the tool bar when a 
track segment is created, that track segment is designated as <i>mainline track</i>,
otherwise it is considered <i>side track</i>. You can change from mainline
track to side track, or vice versa, in the Edit Track dialog. Mainline track and 
side track may be drawn with different width lines. Track widths for each are set 
using the <b>Set Track Width...</b> item in the Options menu.</p>
<p>
Optionally, you can designate which <b>Block</b> a track segment is in--either by 
entering a block name in the <b>Block: Name</b> field of the tool bar prior to 
creating each track segment, or by entering a block name in the Edit Track Segment 
dialog at a later time. The Edit Track Segment dialog also allows a Create/Edit 
Block dialog to be requested, so information for the track segment's block may be 
entered or changed. (Blocks are discussed more fully below.)</p>

<a name="xing"><h3>Level Crossings
</h3></a>
<p>
A level crossing is a special piece of track that represents two tracks crossing
at grade. A level crossing is commonly referred to as a diamond. A level crossing 
has four connection points, and two tracks, designated 1 and 2. When a level 
crossing is created, track 1 is the horizontal track, and track 2 is the inclined 
track. The angle between the two tracks, the incline of each track, and the
length of each track may be varied by dragging connection points with the meta key 
pressed. The center of the level crossing may be positioned by dragging the center 
circle with the meta key pressed (see the help bar for which key is the meta key 
for your operating system).</p>
<p>
Optionally each track will be either <i>mainline track</i> or <i>side track</i> 
depending on the mainline track or side track designation of the track segments 
connected to each track. Also optionally you may independently assign each track
to a different block. If a block name is entered in the <b>Block: Name</b> field 
of the tool bar prior to creating a level crossing, that block is assigned to 
both tracks. Each track may be assigned to a different block in the Edit 
Level Crossing dialog. The Edit Level Crossing dialog also allows a Create/Edit 
Block dialog to be requested for each of the two blocks, so information for these 
blocks may be entered or changed. The block(s) assigned to a level crossing may 
be different from the block(s) of connected track segments; in this case, each
level crossing connecting point where the block changes serves as a block 
boundary. (Blocks are discussed more fully below.)</p>

<a name="turn"><h3>Turntables
</h3></a>
<p>
A Layout Editor turntable is a schematic representation of a turntable on the 
layout. A turntable is drawn as a circle with a variable number of track 
connections, called <i>ray tracks</i>. Each <i>ray track</i> is drawn 
as a short stub track radiating from the turntable circle. A track segment 
should connect to each ray track. Most of these track segments will connect 
a ray track to an end bumper. The distance of each ray track connection point 
from the turntable circle is fixed, but the direction of each ray track may be
varied by dragging its connection point around the turntable circle. Any 
number of turntables may be added to a panel, and each turntable may have 
any number of ray tracks.</p>
<p>
A turntable is added to a panel by selecting <b>Add Turntable</b> in the 
panel's Option menu. New turntables are placed at the center of the 
panel, and should be moved to desired locations by dragging its center 
point with the meta key pressed (right button drag on Windows). When a 
turntable is added, it has four ray tracks located in up, down, left, and
right directions. The turntable's popup menu has two items. Selecting
<b>Edit...</b> brings up an Edit Turntable dialog, and selecting <b>Remove</b> 
deletes the turntable and any track segments connected to it. Before a 
turntable is actually deleted, the program asks for verification of that
action.</p>
<p>
The Edit Turntable dialog allows the radius of the turntable circle to be 
changed, and provides for the addition and deletion of ray tracks. For more
information on how to add and delete ray tracks, see the help page of the 
Edit Turntable dialog.</p>

<a name="background"><h3>Backgrounds
</h3></a>
<p>
Background images are not required for Layout Editor panels. Support for 
adding a background is provided for panels that require other than the 
default Layout Editor background. Background images may be used simply to change 
the color of the Layout Editor background, or for more sophisticated 
applications, such as setting up a CTC panel.</p>
<p>
A background image may be created using any pixel-based image editor to 
create the image, and to save it as a .gif format image file. You may create a 
single background image for the whole panel, or create vertical slices to be 
used in a multi-slice background (see below). For a multi-slice background, 
create your slice image(s), then add copies, one to the right of the other, 
until the desired panel area is covered. </p>
<p>
<b>Important Note: if you create your own background images (or icons) don't store 
them with the JMRI predefined images or they will be deleted when you upgrade 
JMRI. Instead, create a new folder called "resources" in your JMRI Preferences 
directory (where your panel file is stored), and add your images and icons to 
that folder.</b></p>
<p>
A background image is added to a panel by selecting <b>Add Background Image...</b> 
in the panel's Option menu. Selecting <b>Add Background Image...</b> brings up a 
file selection dialog for selecting the file containing the background image. 
Layout Editor provides for multiple background images. The first background 
image is placed with its upper left corner at x = 0, and y = 0. The next 
background image is placed at the top of the panel and to the right of right-most 
existing background image. This allows easy implementation of multi-slice 
background images (see below).  The <i>x, y</i> location of the upper left corner 
of each background image is shown in it's popup menu. This location may be 
changed by selecting <b>Set x & y</b> in the popup menu.</p>
<p>
For users building a classic US&S panel, there are two sets of predefined image 
'slices' currently available. One set is 718 pixels high, and the second set is 
900 pixels high. Choose the set that best fits your display. These 'slices' are 
located at icons/USS/background/. The 900 pixel high images include a "-9" in 
their names. The left and right edge images are each 12 pixels wide. The main 
panel 'slices' are 65 pixels wide. First add the left edge image, then 
add a blank slice or one including switch plate(s) for each turnout on your
CTC panel, then finish by adding the right edge image. The advantages of 
building CTC backgrounds with slices are that 1) you can make virtually any 
length CTC panel, and 2) the plates will be precisely located automatically.</P>





<a name="block"><h3>Blocks
</h3></a>
<p>
Blocks are sections of track whose occupancy may be individually monitored. 
Dividing track into blocks is optional. Blocks set up in a track diagram 
normally correspond to physical blocks on a layout. Block occupancy is indicated 
by the state of an <i>occupancy sensor</i>. When a layout's track is divided 
into blocks, all of the track need not belong to a block. For example, yard track
is normally not in a block, whereas mainline track almost always would be divided 
into blocks. The main use of blocks is to facilitate signaling, but blocks may 
be used for other layout control and animation functions.</p>
<p>
If a block name is entered in the <b>Block: Name</b> field of the tool bar prior 
to adding a turnout, level crossing, or track segment, the added item is assigned 
to that block; if a sensor name (system name or user name) was entered into the
<b>Occupancy Sensor</b> field, that sensor will be assigned to the entered block. 
A turnout, level crossing, or track segment may also be assigned
to a block by entering that block's name in the edit dialog accessed by
selecting <b>Edit...</b> in that items popup menu. In either case, if a block 
with the entered name doesn't exist, one is created.</p>
<p>
A block name may be any series of alphabetic or numeric characters that describe 
the block, for example, "Red Main 2", "Lake Siding", or "Moose Block". Once a 
block is created, its name may not be changed; attempting to change a block's 
name will create a new block having the new name. After all items assigned to
the old block are changed to the new block, the block with the old name will
be automatically deleted (see below).</p>
<p>
Turnout, level crossing, and track segment edit dialogs provide access to the 
Create/Edit Block dialog where information specific to a block may be entered
or edited. The <b>Occupancy Sensor:</b> field in the Create/Edit Block dialog 
shows the name of the occupancy sensor currently assigned to the block, if there
is one. To enter or change the occupancy sensor, enter the name (system name or
user name) of a sensor in the Sensor Table in the <b>Occupancy Sensor:</b> field. 
A sensor may be assigned as the occupancy sensor of only one block; attempting 
to do otherwise will result in an error message. Normally, the state of an 
occupancy sensor is "Active" when a block is occupied, so "Active" for occupied 
sense is the automatic default. This can be changed by selecting "Inactive" in 
the <b>Occupied Sense:</b> selection box.</p>
<p>
Block track colors are used instead of the default track color if a section of 
track is in a block. The track items in a block are drawn with different track 
colors for occupied and unoccupied states, allowing the track in a block to 
change color as a train enters and leaves that block. To set track colors, 
select the unoccupied track color in the <b>Track Color:</b> selection box, 
and select the occupied track color in the <b>Occupied Track Color:</b> 
selection box.</p>
<p>
Since blocks are items on the physical layout, the same block may be used in 
more than one panel. Consequently, block information is saved in the non-panel 
specific portion of the layout information, when panels are saved to a
file on disk.</p>
<p>
Blocks are deleted automatically when they are no longer used. Layout Editor 
keeps track of the number of track items (turnouts, track segments,
and level crossings) that are assigned to a block. This count is displayed in
the Create/Edit Block dialog as <b>Current Use Count:</b>. When panels are saved to
disk, only those blocks with a use count greater than zero are saved.</p>

<a name="finish"><h3>Putting Finishing Touches on your Panel
</h3></a>
<p>
Below is an enhanced version of the simple oval panel constructed in  
<b>Getting Started with Layout Editor</b>. The general steps needed to get from 
that starting panel to this panel are sketched below. The steps need not be done 
in the exact same order presented. The presented order works, but variations are 
possible to get to the same end point. This example is presented to illustrate 
some of the things what can be done easily using Layout Editor. You may elect 
to do more or less on your Layout Editor panels.</p>
<A href="./images/OvalLayoutEditMode.gif"><IMG SRC="./images/EnhancedPanel.gif" 
ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="171" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0"></A>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Turnouts from the Turnout Table were assigned to each turnout drawing 
	using the <b>Edit...</b> item in each turnout's popup menu.</li>
	<li>Three new anchor points were added-one on each side vertical track, 
	and one on the bottom track to serve as <i>block boundaries</i>. Block 
	boundaries are places on the track where two blocks join; track at a block
	boundary is normally gapped on the physical layout. Adding anchor points
	was made easier by using the <b>Translate Selection</b>... tool in the 
	Tools menu, to spread out the original panel in the vertical and 
	horizontal directions.</li>	
	<li>Layout track was divided into blocks by assigning block names to 
	all track segments and turnouts. When a block name is entered, if a block 
	by that name doesn't exist, a new block is automatically created. Turnouts 
	were placed in the same block as the track segment connected to their throats 
	(facing points), and track segments connecting to turnout continuing and 
	diverging points were placed in different blocks.</li>
	<li>Block names were placed on the panel using <b>Text Label</b> on the 
	tool bar. This was done for this illustrated example, but you may or may 
	not want to display block names on your final panel.</li>
	<li>Each block was assigned an occupancy sensor from the Sensor Table. 
	Sensors were added to the Sensor Table prior to assigning occupancy 
	sensors. An occupancy sensor was assigned to each block using the 
	<b>Create/Edit Block</b> button in the <b>Edit Track Segment</b> dialog 
	of one of the track segments in the block.</li>
	<li>Track on the main oval were designated <i>mainline track</i> using the 
	<b>Edit Track Segment</b> dialog for each track segment. This gave 
	different track widths for mainline and side track.</li>
	<li>Signal Heads were defined in the Signals Table for each of the signals 
	to be placed on the panel. Triple turnout signal head types were used for 
	all.</li>
	<li>Signals were placed at turnouts using the <b>Set Signals at Turnout</b> 
	tool in the Tools menu. For each signal head <b>Add Signal Icon to Panel</b> 
	was checked, but <b>Set up Logic</b> was not.</li>
	<li>Signals were placed at block boundaries at the three anchor points 
	using <b>Set Signals at Block Boundary</b> in the Tools menu. <b>Add Signal 
	Icon to Panel</b> was checked, but <b>Set up Logic</b> was not.</li>
	<li>Logic for the signals at turnouts was set up using <b>Set Signals at 
	Turnout</b>. The name of the turnout was entered, then <b>Get Saved</b> 
	was clicked to retrieve the turnout names. Next <b>Set up Logic</b> was 
	checked for each signal head, and <b>Add Signal Icon to Panel</b> was 
	not.</li>
	<li>Logic for signals at anchor point block boundaries was set up using 
	<b>Set Signals at Block Boundary</b> by following a similar procedure.</li>
	<li>Since all signals will show red if occupancy sensors are in an "Unknown"
	state, the Sensor Table was opened and all occupancy sensors were set to
	"Inactive" (unoccupied) by clicking "Unknown" once. Then the industry 
	turnout was clicked to set it to thrown, producing the panel shown above 
	(with Edit Mode switched off in the Options menu).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You should be able to toggle your turnouts by clicking at their centers and 
watch your signals change color. If you don't have hardware yet for your 
occupancy sensors, you can change their state in the Sensor Table to simulate
a train moving on the layout. (Or you could set up Sensor Icons and click on 
them to change their state.) If any of the above steps are not clear, 
consult the description of that item in the documentation above. The help 
page for each referenced tool also contains explanatory information about
that tool.</p>
<p>
This is an example of what can easily be done using Layout Editor. 
For those planning to install signals, setting up a panel with
blocks defined and signals placed can help in deciding where blocks and 
signals should be placed before actually installing them on your layout.</p>
