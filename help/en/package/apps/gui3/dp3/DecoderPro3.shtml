<H1>Introduction to Decoder Pro 3</H1>
	<p>  <B> THIS HELP FILE IS WORK IN PROGRESS </B>.  Please help JMRI by contributing to improve this help file !
	</p>
	<p> Decoder Pro 3 presents a list of your locomotives (the Roster) and provides access to tools for programming decoder configuration variables (CV's).  
	</p>

<H1>Description of Decoder Pro 3 Window</H1>
	<p>  The Decoder Pro 3 Window is divided into five main sections from top to bottom. </p>
	<img src="helpfile_dump1.jpg" width="526" height="266" />
	<ol>
		<li> <a href="#menubar">The Menu Bar</a>. </li>
		<li> The Tool Bar (or Button Bar).   Containing buttons and controls. </li>
		<li> The Roster Table.  Containing a list of decoders in your Roster. An entry in the Roster can be highlighted with the mouse.  </li>
		<li> The Decoder Information Area.  This shows information about the highlighted entry in the Roster table.  </li>
		<li> A status bar.  This reports information in a single line. </li>
	</ol>  

<H1>Main Tasks with Decoder Pro 3</H1>
<p>Decoder Pro 3 is designed for the management of DCC decoders fitted to locomotives.  The locomotives known to Decoder Pro 3 are displayed in the Roster Table.  The anticipated main tasks are: creating a new locomotive and changing the settings in an existing locomotive (programming).  
</p>
<H2>New Locomotive</H2> 
	<p> To add a new locomotive (or first locomotive), click on the "New Loco" button on the Tool Bar.  This will open a "Create New Loco" window, where the decoder can be either identified or selected from the list.  To create the locomotive, having selected (or identified) a decoder, select the Programmer format (Basic or Comprehensive) and click "Open Programmer".   A Programming window for the new locomotive will open, with the "Roster Entry" tab foremost.  It is recommended to give the locomotive a name in the "ID:" field, and then click "Save to Roster".   You can also proceed to program the decoder, giving it a DCC address (in the "Basic" tab), and set other values.  On closing the Programming window, if prompted, save the results into the Roster. 
</p>

<H2>Identify Existing Locomotive</H2>
	<p> If a locomotive is placed on the Programming Track, the "Identify" button will read details from the decoder and try to match it to an entry in the Roster Table.   Some decoders only work with a limited range of programming modes, and it may be necessary to change the programming mode with the "Set" button.   If a locomotive is correctly identified, it will be highlighted in the Roster Table, and its details will appear in the lower Decoder Information Area. 
	</p>
	
<H2>Programming an existing Locomotive</H2>
	<p>  Once a locomotive has been selected, either by manually finding it within the Roster Table, or through the "Identify" button, a summary of its details will appear in the lower Decoder Information Area.  Buttons to open the programmer are to the right of the Decoder Information Area.   
	</p>
	<p> Select the type of programming required with the radio buttons, choose between the Programming Track, Programming on the Main Line or Edit the file only (no programming of a locomotive).  Having selected the type of programming, you can open either the Basic Programmer (which allows change of locomotive address) or the Comprehensive Programmer (which allows changing of all locomotive decoder features known to DecoderPro). 
	</p>

<H2>Changing Throttle Labels and Roster Media</H2>
	<p>  Throttle Labels are used by the JMRI on-screen Throttles and by the smart-phone throttles through the WiThrottle interface.  They allow Function keys to have meaningful names such as "Horn", "Whistle", rather than "F2" and "F4".   Their use is optional. 
	</p>
	<p>  Roster Media is where pictures of locomotives can be loaded into JMRI.  These are displayed in the Roster, and can be used within Throttles.  Their use is optional. 
	</p>
	

<H2>Roster Groups</H2>
<p> Roster Groups are a means of filtering your entries in the Roster.  For example, you might have "diesel locos", "steam locos", but also "Burlington Locos" and "Canadian Pacific Locos".  Thus a single locomotive in the Roster could be a member of several groups.   Roster Groups are used to filter the Roster View in Decoder Pro 3, and select the locomotives offered in an on-screen Throttle. 
</p>
<p> To create your first Roster Group, use the "Create Roster Group" command on the "Settings" menu.  When you have created a Roster Group, a new drop-list is added to the Tool Bar in Decoder Pro 3.  Having created a group, it is initially empty.  The next step is to add locomotives to the group.  This is done with the "Roster Group Table Association" command on the "Settings" menu.  With the "Roster Group Table" window, select the Roster Group in the drop-menu, and then place a tick alongside all locomotives requires in that group.  Repeat for any other groups, and when finished close the window with the close-box in the upper right-hand corner.
