<H1>JMRI: Preferences Window</H1>

The preferences window is where you 
configure the basic operation of your JMRI application.
<p>
The screen is split into two sections, on the left hand side is a list of the preference groups that can be set. 
Clicking on each preference will then populate the right hand side, with the various options that can be configured.

<p>Perhaps the most important control is at the bottom of this section:
The "Save" button!  
<p>
Be sure to click "Save" when leaving this window.  Your changes to the preferences
don't take effect until the program is stopped and restarted, so the
program will prompt you to do that after saving the preferences.

This page is under construction. 
In the meantime, there's some more information on preferences
on some 
<a href="../../manual/Getting_Started.shtml#Preferences">tutorial pages</a>.

<a name="Connection">
<h2>Connections</h2></a>

You can select any of the various JMRI layout connections here.<p>
Each connection has its own unique tab, to get started, first select your DCC System Manufacturer,
followed by the type of connection that you are using.  You will then be presented with a series of 
most commonly required settings that need to be set.  If you need to change some of the more advanced 
settings then connection then check the "Additional Connection Settings" box and this will provide you with 
further details.
<p>
To add an additional connection click on the tab with a "+", this will then present you with a fresh 
connection tab.  To remove a connection, in the system manufacture drop down list, select (none selected) 
and this will remove the configuration for that connection.
<p>
For more information on how to configure this for your particular hardware,
see the <a href="../../html/hardware/index.shtml">hardware pages</a>.
<p>
Remember to press save!

<a name="Defaults">
<h2>Defaults</h2></a>

If you are using multiple connections of the same type, e.g. multiple
LocoNet connections, this pane lets you select which one is connected
to e.g. the CV programmer you want to use.

<a name="Startup">
<h2>Start Up</h2></a>
This deals with all the preferences that are invoked at start up such as loading panel files and running scripts.
<dl>
<dt>Actions
<dd>
This section lets you have the program automatically
execute various menu selections at startup.  For example,
you can have the Turnout Table automatically open, or 
automatically open a window for programming on the main.
<P>
For example, to automatically open the Turnout Table, 
click the "Add Action" button in this section of the advanced preferences. 
From the list that's presented, select "Open Turnout Table". 
Don't forget
to save your updated preferences with the button at the bottom of the screen!

<dt>Buttons
<dd>
This allows you to add extra buttons to the main JMRI window
that are connected to specific menu choices.
<P>
For example, to add a button that will open the Power Control when clicked, 
click the "Add Action" button in this section of the advanced preferences.  
From the list that's presented, select "Open Turnout Table". Don't forget
to save your updated preferences with the button at the bottom of the screen!
From the list that's presented, select "Open Power Control". 
Don't forget
to save your updated preferences with the button at the bottom of the screen!
The button will appear when you next start the program.

<dt>Files
<dd>
This section lets you automatically load panel files when the program
starts up.  The previous sections will have already executed, so any actions
they're configured for will have taken place.  You can load
as many panel files as you'd like; each will be completely loaded before the next
is started.
<p>
Click "Add File", which will open a file section window in which you can select the 
desired file.  If you later want to stop loading the file at startup, 
click the "Remove" button next to the filename.

<dt>Scripts
<dd>
This section lets you automatically run a script file when the program
starts up.  The previous sections will have already executed, so any actions
they're configured for will have taken place
and all panel files will have been loaded.  
You can run as many script files
as you'd like; each will be run to the end of the file before the next
is started.
<p>
Click "Add File", which will open a file section window in which you can select the 
desired file.  If you later want to stop executing a particular script at startup, 
click the "Remove" button next to the filename.
</dl>


<a name="Display">
<h2>Display</h2></a>

<dl>
<dt>GUI
<dd>These radio boxes allow you to select how the program looks.
The available choices depend on what kind of computer you have, and not 
all of the following may be available:
    <ul>
    <li>Metal - the default Java style, usable on all computers
    <li>CDE/Motif - A Linux/Unix form that works well with X Windows
        screen managers.  It's also available on (almost) all computer types.
    <li>Windows - only available on Microsoft Windows systems, this makes the
        program look as much as possible like a regular Windows application.
    <li>Mac OS X - only available on MacOS, this makes the program look
        like a Macintosh application
    </ul>
<dt>Locale
<dd><a href="../../Acknowledgements.shtml">Many people</a> have contributed "internationalizations"
of JMRI.  This converts (much) of the text on the screen to a language
other thank English.  If you select your country or region and language here,
then save and restart the preferences, JMRI will use an internationalization
for that country and language if it's available.  Items that have not been translated 
will continue to appear in English, so you won't miss anything.  For
more information on how to set this up, and particularly how to contribute
new and improved translations, please see our
<a href="../../html/doc/Technical/I8N.shtml">internationalization page</a>.
</dl>


<a name="Messages">
<h2>Messages</h2></a>
This allows you to change the way that information and warning messages are displayed in JMRI.  <br>
It will also allow you to configure a default responses and the question being displayed.



<a name="Roster">
<h2>Roster</h2></a>

<dl>
<dt>Programmer
<dd>The DecoderPro programmer allows you to select how much or how little
to display of the decoder content using configurable "Programmers". You 
can select one at the same time you 
<a href="../../manual/Basic_Programming.shtml">select your locomotive decoder</a>,
but this provides a convenient place to set a default so you don't
have to select it each time you open a decoder.

<p>
This section also has a checkbox that lets you decide whether the DecoderPro
programmer will display empty panes (tabs). 
Some people like to see them, even though they're empty,
some people would prefer not to see them, 
so they don't keep trying to look at them.  
We provide this preference so you can choose.

<a id="roster">
<dt>Roster
<dd>
Normally, the roster is stored in a standard location
as part of the
<a href="../../html/apps/DecoderPro/Files.shtml">preferences directory</a>.
This option lets you move that somewhere else.
<p>
To configure it, click the "Set..." button and follow the directions.
<p>
The "Reset" button restores it to the default location. Note that
this just changes where the program looks.  If you've stored roster
information elsewhere and want it back in the default location, you have
to move the files there yourself.
<p>
You can also enter a default value for the "Owner" field in DecoderPro
roster entries here.  This fills in the value for new entries, which 
can save you a little bit of typing. It has no effect on 
existing entries, even if changed.

</dl>

<a name="Throttle">
<h2>Throttle</h2></a>

This preference pane lets you select whether the extended throttle
features are available, and which ones can be used.

<a name="WiThrottle">
<h2>WiThrottle</h2></a>

<dl>
<dt>eStop

<dd>If selected,
listens for a packet to be sent from the connected mobile device.
If the server does not receive any communication in the
chosen time, the affected JMRI throttle will idle its train.

<p>
The chosen time is approximate, the response may be a few seconds
earlier or later.

<dt>Network

<dd>Select the check box to assign a specific port number to use.
Automatic will allow the computer to select an available port number.
<p>
<dt>Allowed Controls

<dd>Check boxes to allow specific features to be controlled by mobile devices.
This will let you to limit what users have the ability to control.
<ul>
    <li>Track Power - Select whether mobile devices connected through
        this WiFi interface can control track power.
    <li>Turnouts - 
    <li>Routes - 
    <li>Consists -
</ul>
</dl>

The "Apply" button puts the current settings into effect, without
saving them permanently.  For a connected throttle to use the
new settings, its connection must be closed and reopened.
