<H1>JMRI: Tabbed Preferences Window</H1>

<a href="images/PrefsCommPane.png">

The preferences window is where you 
configure the basic operation of your JMRI application.
It has a series of tabs on which you can set 
the various kinds of options.

<p>
Perhaps the most important control is at the bottom of the window:
The "Save" button!  
<p>
Be sure to click "Save" when leaving this window.  Your changes to the preferences
don't take effect until the program is stopped and restarted, so the
program will prompt you to do that after saving the preferences.

<a name="comm">
<h2>Communications Preferences</h2></a>
<p>
When the window first opens, it displays the 
panel for configuring a connection to the layout.
There are four of these, so you can configure up to four connections.
<p>
You can select any of the various JMRI layout connections here.
For more information on how to configure this for your particular hardware,
see the <a href="../../html/hardware/index.shtml">hardware pages</a>.

<h2>Programmer Defaults</h2>
<a href="images/PrefsProgPane.png">
<img src="images/PrefsProgPane.png" height="225" width="255" align="right"></a>
Next, there's a "Programmer" pane.
The DecoderPro programmer allows you to select how much or how little
to display of the decoder content using configurable "Programmers". You 
can select one at the same time you 
<a href="../../manual/Basic_Programming.shtml">select your locomotive decoder</a>,
but this provides a convenient place to set a default so you don't
have to select it each time you open a decoder.
<p>
There's also a checkbox whether you want empty panes (tabs that don't 
contain any information for your particular decoder) to be listed.

<a name="actions">
<h2>Actions</h2>

<a href="images/PrefsActPane.png">
<img src="images/PrefsActPane.png" height="225" width="255" align="right"></a>

This section lets you have the program automatically
execute various menu selections at startup.  For example,
you can have the Turnout Table automatically open, or 
automatically open a window for programming on the main.
<P>
For example, to automatically open the Turnout Table, 
click the "Add Action" button in this section of the advanced preferences. 
From the list that's presented, select "Open Turnout Table". 
Don't forget
to save your updated preferences with the button at the bottom of the screen!

<h2>Buttons</h2>

This allows you to add extra buttons to the main JMRI window
that are connected to specific menu choices.
<P>
For example, to add a button that will open the Power Control when clicked, 
click the "Add Action" button in this section of the advanced preferences.  
From the list that's presented, select "Open Turnout Table". Don't forget
to save your updated preferences with the button at the bottom of the screen!
From the list that's presented, select "Open Power Control". 
Don't forget
to save your updated preferences with the button at the bottom of the screen!
The button will appear when you next start the program.

<h2>Files</h2>

This section lets you automatically load panel files when the program
starts up.  The previous sections will have already executed, so any actions
they're configured for will have taken place.  You can load
as many panel files as you'd like; each will be completely loaded before the next
is started.
<p>
Click "Add File", which will open a file section window in which you can select the 
desired file.  If you later want to stop loading the file at startup, 
click the "Remove" button next to the filename.

<h2>Scripts</h2>

This section lets you automatically run a script file when the program
starts up.  The previous sections will have already executed, so any actions
they're configured for will have taken place
and all panel files will have been loaded.  
You can run as many script files
as you'd like; each will be run to the end of the file before the next
is started.
<p>
Click "Add File", which will open a file section window in which you can select the 
desired file.  If you later want to stop executing a particular script at startup, 
click the "Remove" button next to the filename.

<h2>GUI Style</h2>
<a href="images/PrefsGuiPane.png">
<img src="images/PrefsGuiPane.png" height="225" width="255" align="right"></a>
These radio boxes allow you to select how the program looks.
The available choices depend on what kind of computer you have, and not 
all of the following may be available:
    <ul>
    <li>Metal - the default Java style, usable on all computers
    <li>CDE/Motif - A Linux/Unix form that works well with X Windows
        screen managers.  It's also available on (almost) all computer types.
    <li>Windows - only available on Microsoft Windows systems, this makes the
        program look as much as possible like a regular Windows application.
    <li>Mac OS X - only available on MacOS, this makes the program look
        like a Macintosh application
    </ul>


<a name="locale">
<h2>Locale</h2>
<a href="images/PrefsLocalePane.png">
<img src="images/PrefsLocalePane.png" height="225" width="255" align="right"></a>
<a href="../../Acknowledgements.shtml">Many people</a> have contributed "internationalizations"
of JMRI.  This converts (much) of the text on the screen to a language
other thank English.  If you select your country or region and language here,
then save and restart the preferences, JMRI will use an internationalization
for that country and language if it's available.  Items that have not been translated 
will continue to appear in English, so you won't miss anything.  For
more information on how to set this up, and particularly how to contribute
new and improved translations, please see our
<a href="../../html/doc/Technical/I8N.shtml">internationalization page</a>.


<a id="roster">
<h2>Roster</h2>
Normally, the roster is stored in a standard location
as part of the
<a href="../../html/apps/DecoderPro/Files.shtml">preferences directory</a>.
This option lets you move that somewhere else.
<p>
To configure it, click the "Set..." button and follow the directions.
<p>
The "Reset" button restores it to the default location. Note that
this just changes where the program looks.  If you've stored roster
information elsewhere and want it back in the default location, you have
to move the files there yourself.
<p>
You can also enter a default value for the "Owner" field in DecoderPro
roster entries here.  This fills in the value for new entries, which 
can save you a little bit of typing. It has no effect on 
existing entries, even if changed.

<a id="messages">
<h2>Messages</h2>
<a href="images/PrefsMsgPane.png">
<img src="images/PrefsMsgPane.png" height="225" width="255" align="right"></a>

The message pane lets you control the various warnings and dialog box options
that JMRI displays.
<p>
Within it are separate panes for different situations...
