English JavaHelp files for JMRI

The JHelpDev.xml file is a convenient project definition for
JHelpDev (http:jhelpdev.sf.net), a tool for maintaining index,
table of contents and map files.  These files may also be manually
maintained in this directory.

Note that the HelpSet definition file (JmriHelp.hs or similar)
lives in the directory above this.  The .cvsignore file here
has been set to ignore it, so that copies created automatically
here don't cause confusion.
