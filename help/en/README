English JavaHelp files for JMRI

This directory contains metadata for the javahelp sub-system,
plus the actual content.

There are several content subtrees:
  DecoderProManual - a help version of the original manual
  html - a help-customized version of the web site
  package - package-sensitive help, organized by Java package
  
For more information on maintaining the various metadata in the 
help system, please see:
<http://jmri.sourceforge.net/doc/Technical/Help.shtml>

The JHelpDev.xml file is a convenient project definition for
JHelpDev (http:jhelpdev.sf.net), a tool for maintaining index,
table of contents and map files.  These files may also be manually
maintained in this directory; JHelpDev will pick up changes when
next run. Note that we use .shtml as the help file name suffix;
this requires a special version of JHelpDev.

The search index files in JavaHelpSearch/ should NOT be 
manually edited.  JHelpDev will overwrite them when next run.

The build.xml and format.xsl files are used to create the webtoc.html
and webindex.html files automatically.
