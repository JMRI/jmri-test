<h3><a NAME="What is DCC"></a>What is DCC?</h3>

<p>
In short, DCC is Digital Command Control, a system for operating model
railroads in a more prototypical manner. Each locomotive contains a tiny,
specialized controller. These controllers (decoders) accept digital commands over a network (the rails) addressed to them and interprets them to control the locomotive's speed, direction, lighting effects, sound, and other functions. Each decoder responds only to those commands addressed to it. Not every decoder will have functions beyond basic throttle commands available. Although there are NMRA&reg; standards for the format of communication (allowing the decoders from different manufacturers to work on the same railroad), beyond that there is considerable variety in the functions supported and the implementation of those functions.
<p>
Just like any other controller, decoders must be programmed by the user
to reach their full potential. While they come with basic "default" programs,
most users will want to customize the decoder address, motor control, lights,
sound, and other functions to meet their specific needs. You do so by editing
<b>CV</b>s, or <b>Configuration Variables</b>, in the decoder. Some CVs use values ranging from 0 to 255, others use their space in the decoder's memory as
a bank of 8 on/off switches. While this lets you do a lot with very little
memory, it can get very complex for those of us that are not on speaking
terms with binary code.
<p>
Decoder Pro attempts to help overcome the inevitable complexity of this
system by providing a clear, usable, user friendly <span class="ACCENT">open
source</span> software solution for programming these on-board decoders.
Programming panel designs are written in <b>XML</b>, (a close relative
of HTML) and can be modified or even created from scratch by users with
even a passing familiarity with the format without previous XML experience.

<p>
Depending on the specifics of your system and computer, some type of hardware
interface may be required.

<h3><a NAME="DCC Hardware"></a>What hardware do I need?</h3>
<p>
You will need, at a minimum, a command station/booster for your DCC system,
and a programming track set up according to the manufacturer's instructions.
For some systems, you will also need an additional hardware interface to
send the commands from your computer to the command station, and from there
on to the decoder in the locomotive. For a Digitrax system, for example,
you will need either the <b>MS100 interface</b>, <strong>PR3 programmer</strong> or a <b>LocoBuffer</b>. The <b>PR1</b> device
from Digitrax is a stand-alone programmer and is <span class="ACCENT">not</span> usable with this software.
<p>You will also need, of course, some locomotives with the decoders  installed  which you can
program.

<h3><a NAME="Start"></a>How do I start the program?</h3>
<p>
Once you have downloaded the Decoder Pro software and installed it, simply
open the program in the usual manner for your operating system. You should
see this or a similar opening screen displayed:

<h1><img src="images/Splash_Screen.png" alt="DecoderPro Splash Screen" width=425 height=265 border=10 class="BOXIT"></h1>

<p>
It may take a while for this screen to come up, especially on older
and slower computers. 
New computers
start the program fairly quickly, but older ones will feel like they're taking
forever. Be patient - it will come up eventually! 
Even on older computers, once the program is up the response time is quite good.
<p>
If this is the first time you have run the program, the preferences
screen will also come up automatically to allow you to set up the system
for your particular configuration.

<h3><a NAME="Preferences"></a>How do I set up my preferences?</h3>
<p>
 Click on the Edit menu and then Preferences... option
in the screen above, which opens the Preferences window. (This window may open automatically the first time you
run the program.) 
<p>The Preferences window provides  access to the basic  configuration information to connect your computer to your DCC system.&nbsp; You will be using that system to  actually&nbsp; program and operate  trains equipped with DCC decoders.
