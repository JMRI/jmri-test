Cars with <strong>loads</strong> other than  empty or loaded can only be serviced by sidings with a.<a href="Ops_shedule.shtml">Schedule. </a> It is strongly recommended that you not  create your own loads until you become very familiar with how the  program works. For many operators, showing whether the car is empty or  loaded adds just enough realism to their operations.<br>

<h4>Build Report Details</h4>
<p>You can adjust the amount of information that the build report will  show. Select one of the four levels using the radio buttons. The program  when generating the build reports stores the "Very Detailed" information  to disk. The radio buttons control how much of that data is actually  printed. The "Minimal" radio button provides the least amount of  information and "Very Detailed" provides the most. If you're only  interested why a train won't build, the "Minimal" setting can provide  you with this information. The "Normal" setting shows which engines and  cars are being excluded from the train, and which engines and cars are  being picked up and dropped. The "Detailed" setting will generate quite  a few pages depending on the size of your railroad. It will show all  available cars and engines, and a bit how the program finds destinations  for the cars and engines. The "Very Detailed" setting produces the most  pages, and will show why cars are not picked up or dropped. Be sure and  press 
  <input type="submit" name="button2" id="button2" value="Save">
  after changing the build report selection.
