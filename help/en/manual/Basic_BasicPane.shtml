<hr>
<p>You may have noticed that at the  top of the window are Two tabs: <strong>Roster Entry</strong> and <strong>Basic</strong>.  We have completed the <strong>Roster Entry</strong> pane of the Program window, now,  click on the <strong>Basic</strong> tab to change panes to continue with programming your  decoder. The Basic pane will be displayed and look similar to the following illustration: 
Many panes in the programmer contain decoder dependent features,  as a result what you see may not exactly agree with what you see here.  Only those variables that your decoder can implement will be shown. </p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/Basic_Program.png" alt="Basic Programming Pane" width=648 height=520 border=5 class="BOXIT">
</div>
<p>You will see three options you can change, highlighted in  yellow: </p>
<ol> 
<li>The decoder address (should be unique among your  locomotives) often the locomotive number is used.</li>
  <li>Two radio buttons that let you toggle between 2 digit  (one byte, normal) or 4 digit <br>
(two byte, extended) addressing </li>

 <li> Analog operation (enables the decoder running under  regular DC voltage/analog <br>
control) </li>
</ol>
<p>The yellow highlighting indicates  these options are &quot;probable&quot; settings and have not been 
confirmed from the decoder. Settings that have been changed by the user and  have not <br>
been written back to the decoder appear in a orange color. You will see  examples of <br>
this throughout the manual. </p>
<a name="Read Data"></a>
To read the actual settings  for these options (and  IF your system and installed decoder will allow readback of decoder values), click  on the  <strong>Read full Sheet </strong>button. The individual settings  will turn red while they are in the process of 
  being read (clever, eh?), and will turn white once the  values have been read successfully 
  from the decoder. Once again, Decoder Pro must play  &quot;Twenty Questions&quot; to get this 
information, and sometimes even has to ask a couple of  times. 
  <p> Be patient, especially with older computers. At the very  bottom of the pane (where it says  &quot;idle&quot;) you will see a running account of  exactly what DecoderPro is doing, for example, the 
  specific CV being read. </p>
<p> Again, the <strong>Read full sheet</strong> and <strong>Read all sheets </strong>functions are  dependant on your command station. If 
  your system does not have the capability to read CVs,  then these buttons will not be 
  available. </p>
<p><a name="Enter/Edit data"></a>If you wish to change the address  of the locomotive, type in the new address. To turn on or off 4 digit  addressing, select the desired radio button. .&nbsp;  Be sure that the address  type agrees with the number of characters in the address. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To enable Analog (old style DC)  Operation select the appropriate entry from the drop-down list. </p>
<p> When you are finished, click on <strong>Write full sheet</strong> to  write the new values in the decoder. It's 
that easy! </p>
  <p><a name="Write Data"></a> Writing usually takes much less time than reading,  because the value can be sent directly. 
  As the write operation proceeds, the data will change  from yellow to white. If there is 
  difficulty writing to the decoder, the data will change  to red. The software will automatically 
  keep trying until the write operation is successful. In some instances the  system will &ldquo;time-out&rdquo; after a certain number of tries without an  acknowledgement from the decoder.&nbsp; This  does not necessarily mean that the values have not been written, just that the  program has not received an acknowledgement.&nbsp;  This can be due to &nbsp;the locomotive  moving and getting on dirty track so that it can&rsquo;t pulse back, or possibly  because the command station or decoder cannot read back.&nbsp; Try moving the loco and try again.&nbsp; If it is a command station or decoder  read-back issue, try the loco on the mainline and see if the programming was  successful. </p>
  <p><a name="Save Data"></a>
  To finish this &quot;basic&quot; programming of a  decoder, click once more on the <strong>Roster Entry</strong> tab, You will see that the  address field has now been filled in, so  you can now 
  click on the <strong>Save to Roster</strong> button. Your new decoder  settings have now been written not only 
  to the decoder, but also saved to a computer file where  they may be recalled in the future. . 
</p>
<a name="Do More"></a>
But you  say...&quot;I want to change more than what's shown on the Basic decoder pane.&quot; Well&hellip; there are other programmers that  are available.&nbsp; But&hellip; first we need to  look at the various options.&nbsp; In  fact there are so many options the programmers had to use a slider to get them  all to show.&nbsp; Here are the option  windows.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t panic&hellip;.Most are of no use  to the average user.
<p align="center"><img src="images/Basic_programmers.png" width="568" height="341" alt="Basic Programmers"><br>
</p>
<p>Comprehensive and Advanced are the only other programmers <strong>Normal Users </strong>will ever need, because it  is, well&hellip;Comprehensive and the Advanced adds features that are optional..&nbsp; So why all the  others?</p>
<p>First of all eliminate the Manufacturer  specific programmers (unless of course you have a Zimo or ESU system).&nbsp; </p>
<p>We can also eliminate the Tutorial and Custom  programmers. They were put in to show folks that want to 
<strong>write their own</strong>&nbsp; programmer (not you right?) 
all the possible ways to gather input and to have a common  starting point in the roster pane. 
Now if you wish to pursue writing a custom programmer go to this 
<a href="../html/apps/DecoderPro/Programmer.shtml" target="_blank">page</a>.</p>
<p>If you have need for a special situation programmer  you might want to look at Sample Club or TrainShowBasic to see what panes can  be taken out of Comprehensive to make an intermediate complexity, special  purpose programmer.&nbsp; Again, how to do this  is a subject for another manual.</p>
<p>And that leaves us with the Advanced and Registers  programmers.&nbsp; The Advanced programmer has a couple of  sophisticated features added on top of the Comprehensive programmer and a name  was needed.&nbsp; Well, why not call it  Advanced? We&rsquo;ll cover the additional features once we get through with  Comprehensive.<br>
  So what about the  Registers programmer?&nbsp; If you have an old or  bargain basement decoder that only programs using registers, then of course  you&rsquo;ll be interested in <strong>Registers.</strong><br>
So now we&rsquo;ve narrowed our &ldquo;real&rdquo; choices down to&nbsp;Advanced, Basic  and Comprehensive. Since we&rsquo;ve already  covered Basic, let's explore the <a href="Comp_Setup_Roster.shtml">Comprehensive Programmer</a>! </p>
