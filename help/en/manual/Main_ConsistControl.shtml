<p align="left">Three types of consists are used on DCC systems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong><em>basic</em></strong> or <strong><em>primary address consist</em></strong>, where each locomotive is assigned the same address on the programming track, or on the main with <a href="Basic_Programming.shtml#OpsMode">OpsMode Programming</a> (if supported by the command station and decoder). <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>A <strong><em>Command Station Assisted Consist </em></strong>(CSAC) which builds the consist using a function of your command station. Command Station Assisted Consists go by the trade names listed below.<br>
    <br>
    <table width="90%" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Manufacturer</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Trade Name</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Usage Notes</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td align="left" valign="top">Digitrax</td>
        <td>Universal Consist</td>
        <td>Limited to the number of slots supported by the system. Allows any address</td>

      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>A <em><strong>Decoder Assisted Consist (</strong></em>DAC), often referred to as Advanced Consist. The NMRA<sup>&reg;</sup> has set aside CV19 as a dedicated location for consist addresses. If CV19 contains a value other than 0, the locomotive will respond to speed and direction instructions sent to the address in CV19. If CV19 contains zero then it will respond to speed and direction commands sent to the usual short or long decoder address. Since the consist address is a single CV, it is limited to the range of 1 to 127. If you add 128 to the consist address, the locomotive will run backwards (relative to it's normal direction of travel) in the consist. The DAC can be set up in the <a href="Comp_Consist.shtml"><strong>Consisting</strong></a> tab in the Comprehensive Programmer.</li>
</ul>
<h4>DecoderPro Consisting Tool</h4>
<p>The consist tool provides a visual tool for manipulating the <em><strong>Decoder Assisted Consists</strong></em> and , on some command stations, <em><strong>Command Station Assisted Consists.</strong></em></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Main_consist_01.png" alt="Consisting Control" width="569" height="355" border="4"></p>
<p>The 
<input name="radio" type="radio" id="radio" value="radio" checked> 
<strong>Advanced Consist</strong> and the 
<input type="radio" name="radio2" id="radio2" value="radio2"> 
<strong>Command Station Consist</strong> allow you to select either consisting mode if supported by your command station. If not supported the options will be grayed out.
<p><strong>Consist</strong> text box: type the consist ID assigned to the locomotives in the consist for <em><strong>Decoder Assisted Consists.</strong></em> For Command Station Consist, this is automatically filled in with the address of the lead locomotive in the consist.
<p><strong>New Locomotive</strong> text box : type in a new locomotive address or select from you roster using the drop-down list. 
<p>Clicking the <strong>add</strong> button will add the locomotive to the consist and it will appear in the list area of the window.
<p>Clicking the <strong>reset </strong>button will clear the information of the current locomotive.
<p>The 
  <input name="checkbox" type="checkbox" id="checkbox" checked> 
<strong>Direction Normal ?  </strong> determines the direction of the locomotive travel as forwarded or reverse when the consist is traveling forward. Will be grayed out until the lead locomotive is selected.
<p><strong>Delete</strong> button removes the consist.      The list of the consist will have a DEL button for each locomotive, allowing you to remove any locomotive from the consist.
<p><a href="Main_Throttle.shtml"><strong>Throttle </strong></a>button opens a throttle for the consist.
<p>Below the <strong>Delete </strong>and <strong>Throttle</strong> button is the status bar, where messages are displayed during the consisting of your locomotives.
