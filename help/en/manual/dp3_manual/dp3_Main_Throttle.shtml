<p>The JMRI&reg; Throttle may be used on your computer screen to replace the vendor throttle that is furnished with your DCC system. One or several throttles may be in use at one time. The Throttle opens as a floating window that may be positioned anywhere on  your desktop. Note the Title Bar contains the locomotive address information.</p>

<p>(color shading added to show functional areas throttle panels)</p>
<p>The Throttle Window contains <a href="dp3_Main_Throttle_menubar.shtml"><strong>Menu Bar</strong></a>, <a href="dp3_Main_Throttle_toolbar.shtml"><strong>Toolbar</strong></a> and three panels which may be enabled or disabled via check box in the View menu. Each panel has a title bar with windows controls to minimize, maximize and exit: :&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Warning!!! </strong>Be careful with the left  hand (minimize) buttons.&nbsp;In Windows, if the little guy is clicked it  will minimize the panel, which means it is no longer visible but the restore  button is lost behind the rest of the panels.&nbsp;  The  way to easily get it back, is to go into the view menu, uncheck  it there,  then go back again and re-check it.&nbsp; You may also drag the panels out of the way to uncover the Maximize icon for a minimized panel.</p>
<p><a href="dp3_Main_Throttle_addressPanel.shtml"><strong>Address Panel </strong></a>(green shading) facilitates setting the address of the locomotive you wish to control with the throttle.</p>
<p><a href="#ControlPanel"><strong>Control Panel</strong></a> (blue shading) contains the controls for applying power to the locomotive that is addressed and controlling speed</p>
<p><a href="#FunctionPanel"><strong>Function Panel</strong></a>(yellow shading) contains all the function buttons used to control the addressed locomotives functions.</p>
<h4>The descriptions shown  above are only a small part of what the <strong>Throttle</strong> Window can do.

Then,  click on <strong>Help</strong> and select <strong>Window Help</strong> from the dropdown box.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s lots of good stuff in there.</h4>
