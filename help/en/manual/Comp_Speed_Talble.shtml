<p>The <strong>Speed Table</strong> allows you to fine-tune the throttle response of your  locomotive. You might opt to match all of your locomotives so they run at the  same speed for the same throttle setting, or you might want to set the table up  so that your locomotive runs at the actual scale speed indicated by the  throttle. Or maybe you have someone in your operating group that likes to  switch the yard at Mach 2.5, and you want to slow them down a bit. There are a  lot of ways to use this feature. (This feature may vary by manufacturer and  decoder series) 
<p> You  now have the option of using <strong>Speed Table </strong>(this pane) which if selected  and written to the decoder will replace the <a href="http://www.daletripp.com/DecoderProManual2-4/Comp_Speed.shtml"><strong>Basic Speed Control</strong></a> to set your locomotive's  speed control mode. Which ever one you select last and write to your decoder  will be the method used for speed control. To select the use of speed tables, the <strong>Use Table</strong> radio button is selected at the top of the pane:

<p>The default speed table for most decoders is a straight line from zero on the left to maximum on the right.  The <b>Force
  Straight</b> button below the table duplicates that.

<p>As you can see, you have both  numbers and sliders to work with. Changing either a number or slider will make the other change to  match it. If you are CV  inquisitive, you can use the tool tip to advantage.&nbsp; By hovering over any of the sliders, the tool  tip will reveal the CV  to which you are pointing . 
<p>The <strong>Match ends</strong> button will  also result in a straight-line graph, but you can offset the beginning and end  by any amount you wish. The first and last steps are used to set to minimum and maximum values for the straight line. The  function will then draw a straight line between those two end points. Below is  an example of the result.

<p>If  you want to set up a loco for switching you can set a start speed that is the  same for the first portion of the throttle revolution and lower the top speed  for use in the yard as shown below:

<p>
If you don't desire a straight-line response curve, there are  other
options available. The <b>Constant ratio curve</b> gives you a response that
increases slowly in the low end, and rapidly at high throttle. This function
will also draw the curve between preset end points.

<p>
The <b>Log curve</b> reverses this response, giving you a logarithmic
response curve with high acceleration at low speeds, but topping out
quickly. It will also draw the curve between preset end points.

<p>
The <b>Shift left</b>  button moves the entire speed table to the left  one space with each click on the button. The example below shows a linear 0-255 speed table that has been <b>Shifted left</b>  three times. 

<h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_ShiftLeft.png" alt="Speed Table - Shift Left" border=5 height=288 width=876></h1>
<p>The <b>Shift right</b> buttons move the entire speed table the right one space with each click on the button. The example below shows a linear 0-255 speed table that has been <b>Shifted right</b> three times. </p>
<h1><img src="images/Speed_Table_ShiftRight.png" alt="Speed Table - Shift Left" border=5 height=258 width=800></h1>
<p>Of course, you can enter the numbers individually or move  the sliders one at a time to 
create your own fully customized speed table. To aid you with  setting the individual  values, the slider value is shown at the top of each slider.&nbsp; Also, by hovering the mouse at a slider  column the number of the CV being entered will be revealed.
<p>
One very important thing to remember: <span class="ACCENT">No matter
how pretty your speed table looks, it has absolutely no effect on the locomotive
unless you write it to the decoder!</span></p>
<p>And this point is especially pertinent with the QSI and  Soundtraxx Tsunami decoders, because they have a separate drop down box like  the QSI box below.&nbsp; They require that you  select the <strong>user defined</strong> speed table  entry in this box or your table will not be written to the decoder.&nbsp; Interestingly, Tsunami puts the selection at  the bottom of the list making it very easy to miss. </p>
