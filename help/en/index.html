<body>

This is the top-level JMRI help page.

<P>
The 
<A HREF="Acknowledgements.html">acknowledgements page</a>
shows that a lot of people have been able to contribute.

<h2>Further information</h2>

The <A href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-announce">jmri-announce</a> 
mailing list carries announcements of new versions, major changes, etc.  
This list is intended to be very low traffic; discussions, etc, should take place elsewhere.
You can subscribe
by sending the word "subscribe" in the subject or body of an email to 
<A HREF="mailto:jmri-announce-request@lists.sourceforge.net">jmri-announce-request@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.
<P>
We have a "JMRI users" Yahoo group for general discussion.  If you want to ask a question, get some
help, or suggest some improvement, that discussion group is a good place.  You can
subscribe, browse posts, etc, at 
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/</A>.<P>

Our <A HREF="http://jmri.sf.net/Technical/index.html">technical web pages</A> are still being written.
This is still an early stage, and we're critically short of documentation.  
But if you're interested
in working with the code, we'd love to help you get started via email, etc.
