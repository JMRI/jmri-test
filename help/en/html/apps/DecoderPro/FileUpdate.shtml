<H1>DecoderPro User Guide - Updating Decoder Definitions</H1>

Many people have contributed decoder definition
files to DecoderPro.  Between new releases, new files will 
be created that you might want to use.  New ones can usually be
found either on
<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/xml/decoders">the JMRI web site</a>
or in the 
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/files/">files area of the jmriusers Yahoo group</a>.
<P>
To use these xml files you need to download and install them.

<P>
<h3>On Windows Systems</h3>
<UL>
<LI>Go to the files menu where the decoder.XML file is located and 
  right click on the file.
 <P>
  (Don't double click or you will open the file rather than saving 
it.)
 
<LI>Choose the menu selection "Save as" or "Save target as".  After 
you 
  choose this menu item a window will pop up and ask you for a 
location 
  that you want to save the file.
 
<P> You can either type in a directory name or click the browse 
button.  
  To save a step I suggest that you choose browse and then select 
  the "program files/JMRI/XML/Decoders" directory. 
 
<P>If you save the file to any other directory, or the desktop you 
will 
  have to copy the file over to the correct directory using the copy 
  and paste in Windows Explorer.  It's easier to just save it in the 
  correct directory in the first place.
 
<LI>Once the file is in the decoders directory you need to open 
Decoder 
  Pro and choose the Debug menu item.  It's one of the menu items on 
  the top horizontal menu on the opening screen. 
 
<LI>From the drop down debug menu choose the item that says "rebuild 
(or 
  recreate) decoder index".  After you have rebuilt the decoder 
index 
  the decoder should show up.
 
<P>The key to make this work is that the downloaded XML file needs to 
be 
  in the JMRI/XML/decoders directory, otherwise Decoder Pro doesn't 
  know that it is there, and won't see it when you rebuild the 
decoder 
  index.

</UL>

<h3>MAC Classic</h3>

<ul>
<LI>If you want to down load one of these "option and click" on it.

<LI>Then copy the 
file into
the JMRI/xml/decoder folder. 
<LI>Once the file is moved, rebuild the decoder 
index through
use of the "Recreate Decoder Index" found under the Debug menu. 
</UL>
