		<p class=subtitle>
		   LocoNet is a trademark of <a href="http://www.digitrax.com">Digitrax, Inc.</a>
		</p>

		<p>The JMRI project contains a number of LocoNet tools.  This
		page introduces them, describes how to use them, and points you
		to installation and other information.</p>
		<dl>
		    <dt><a HREF="#locomon"><dfn>LocoNet monitor</dfn></a></dt>
		    <dd>
			Display and log the traffic on the LocoNet, in either
			hex or human readable form.
		    </dd>

		    <dt><a HREF="#slotmon"><dfn>Slot monitor</dfn></a> </dt>
		    <dd> Watch the contents of the command station's slots as
		    they're changed.</dd>

		    <dt><a HREF="#sendpkt"><dfn>Packet source</dfn></a> </dt>
		    <dd> A tool to let you type and send packets to the LocoNet</dd>

		    <dt><a HREF="#pm4"><dfn>BDL16, BDL162 and PM4 programmers</dfn></a> </dt>
		    <dd> A tool to let help you configure BDL16, BDL162 and PM4 boards.</dd>

		    <dt><a HREF="#locoio"><dfn>LocoIO programmer</dfn></a> </dt>
		    <dd> A tool to let help you configure a LocoIO board.</dd>
		</dl>

		<p>
		These tools also present in the JMRI demo program, and to some
		extent in DecoderPro. And, of course, you can build them into a
		program of your own!  The LocoNet Tools program is simply a
		convenient platform for finding and accessing these features.</p>

		<p>The libraries also contain utilities for controlling your
		layout (operating turnouts and signals, responding to inputs
		and block occupancy, etc), for programming decoders, and
		others.  These are not LocoNet specific, so are described
		elsewhere on this web site.</p>

			<p>The LocoNet Monitor tool displays LocoNet traffic in a
			human-readable form. The last 20 messages are available
			in a scrolling window. Optionally, you can include the
			time the message was received, and/or the raw packet
			bytes. The log information can also be stored in a text
			file.</p>

			<p>
			The Slot Monitor tool displays a table of the "command
			station slots'" contents. Slots are used to control
			individual locomotives and consists. The display
			includes the decoder's speed step format, current speed
			and function settings, consist information and status.
			You can choose to show either all slots or just the
			ones being actively used.

			The Send Packet tool lets you type in a LocoNet packet
			and send it to the layout. You type the packet in
			hexadecimal as pairs of characters, in the same way its
			displayed in the LocoNet monitor.

		    <p>
			The PM4 programmer and BLDL16 programmer tools provide
			a simple graphic interface for configuring Digitrax
			power and block-occupancy boards. Each "option switch"
			is shown as a checkbox on the screen. You can read the
			current contents from the board, and write your changes
			back easily. There is no need to remove the board from
			the layout, or climb underneath the layout to push
			buttons, as all programming is done via the board's
			LocoNet connection.

		    The LocoIO programmer provides a simple interface for configuring
		    <a HREF="http://www.locobuffer.com/LocoIO.htm">John Jabour's LocoIO board</a>, 
		    a powerful component for building CTC boards and control
		    panels. (More information on the board is available at
		    <a HREF="http://www.locobuffer.com/LocoIO.htm">http://www.locobuffer.com/LocoIO.htm</a>)
		    </p>

		    <p>A LocoIO board has 16 signal pins, each of which can be
		    programmed as an input or output, and to do a number of
		    different things. The board is also sometimes described as
		    having 16 channels.</p>

		    <p>The channels are configured via LocoNet messages,
		    so you don't need physical access to the board to 
		    program it (you can do it without pushing any buttons
		    on the board or rewiring it). </p>

		    <p>
		    More information on the JMRI LocoIO programmer is
		    available on a
		    <A HREF="LocoIO.shtml">separate page</a>.
