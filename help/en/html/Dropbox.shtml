<h1>JMRI: Sharing Files with Dropbox</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com"><img src="https://dt8kf6553cww8.cloudfront.net/static/images/icons/blue_dropbox_glyph-vflJ8-C5d.png" align="right"></a>
is a free service that lets you share files between multiple computers across a network.
Once you've signed up with Dropbox, you can configure JMRI to use it to share
rosters, layout configuration files and other information between multiple computers.

<p>
To set this up:
<ul>
<li>Create a JMRI folder in Dropbox on the first computer.
<li>
If you have already created items (roster entries, panels etc.) go to Help->Locations and 
press Open User Files Location.<br>
<a href="Help_Locations.png"><img src="Help_Locations.png" width="682" height="139"></a>
<br>This will open a window on your desktop showing a directory.
Remember where that is, because you'll move items from there later.
<li>Still on the Help->Locations window, check to see if your Roster Location is different from the User Files Location.
If so, click Open Roster Location to open a window on that location.  You'll copy files
from there later.<br>
<a href="Help_Locations_Roster.png"><img src="Help_Locations_Roster.png" width="682" height="139"></a>
<li>Preferences->Roster->Roster->Roster Location->Reset. Do not enter a Roster Location. That way it will follow User Files Location.<br>
<a href="Roster_Reset.png"><img src="Roster_Reset.png" width="416" height="159"></a>
<li>Preferences->File Locations->User Files Location and set it to the JMRI folder you created in Dropbox.<br>
<a href="Locations_Files.png"><img src="Locations_Files.png" width="418" height="157"></a>
<li>Restart JMRI and use Help -> Locations to make sure everything is changed correctly.
<li>If you have already created any files of the types listed at this link
(see <a href="../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#FileLocations">this page</a> for help), 
move them from the old location to your new location. For example, your files
in the User Files window we opened at the first step should be moved to the
new User Files location you just created. 
</ul>
<p>
The only steps you need to do on subsequent machines are:
<ul>
<li>Preferences->Roster->Roster->Roster Location->Reset. Do not enter a Roster Location. That way it will follow User Files Location.
<li>Preferences->Locations->User Files Location and set it to the JMRI folder you created in Dropbox.
</ul>
