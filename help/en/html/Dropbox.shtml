<h1>JMRI: Sharing Files with Dropbox</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com"><img src="https://dt8kf6553cww8.cloudfront.net/static/images/icons/blue_dropbox_glyph-vflJ8-C5d.png" align="right"></a>
is a free service that lets you share files between multiple computers across a network.
Once you've signed up with Dropbox, you can configure JMRI to use it to share
rosters, layout configuration files and other information between multiple computers.

<p>
To set this up:
<ul>
<li>Create a JMRI folder in Dropbox on the first computer.
<li>(If you have already created items (roster entries, panels etc.) go to Help->Locations and 
press Open User Files Location (and also Roster Location, only if it differs from User Files Location). 
You will need to move your items from there later.)
<li>Preferences->Roster->Roster->Roster Location->Reset. Do not enter a Roster Location. That way it will follow User Files Location.
<li>Preferences->Locations->User Files Location and set it to the JMRI folder you created in Dropbox.
<li>Restart JMRI and use Help -> Locations to make sure everything is changed correctly.
<li>(If you have already created any of the items listed at this link, move them from the old location to the new User Files Location:
see <a href="http://jmri.org/help/en/package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml#FileLocations">this page</a>. )
</ul>
<p>
The only steps you need to do on subsequent machines are:
<ul>
<li>Preferences->Roster->Roster->Roster Location->Reset. Do not enter a Roster Location. That way it will follow User Files Location.
<li>Preferences->Locations->User Files Location and set it to the JMRI folder you created in Dropbox.
</ul>
