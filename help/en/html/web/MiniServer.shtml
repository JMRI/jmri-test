<h1> 
JMRI: Mini Web Server
</h1>

The JMRI mini web server is meant to be a quick and easy
way for model railroaders, not Masters of the Web, 
to get a web connection to JMRI up and running.  If you really
want to have a powerful web server, you're better off
downloading a copy of 
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>
and 
<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>
and learning to configure those, rather than trying to get a
lot of performance out of the JMRI mini web server.  But if you
must reconfigure it, this page provides some additional information.

<h2>Configuration</h2>

Several properties files configure the JMRI mini web server and its
default features.

<dl>
<dt>jmri/web/miniserver/Services.properties
<dd>This file provides a mapping from URLs to the servlets that
handle them.  It's most useful for controlling access to
the FileServlet (which serves the contents of local files), and
mapping the URL that corresponds to JMRI panels via the
<a href="FrameServlet.shtml">FrameServlet</a>.

<dt>jmri/web//miniserver/Html.properties
<dd>Provides the "boiler plate" text for HTTP replies and certain
HTML responses.

<dt>jmri/web//miniserver/servlet/fileservlet/FileServletPaths.properties
<dd>Maps URLs presented to the FileServlet to locations in the file system.
This servlet is somewhat JMRI-specific, in that it knows about the location
of the current JMRI preferences directory; see the comment at the front of the file.

<dt>jmri/web//miniserver/servlet/fileservlet/FileServletTypes.properties
<dd>Specifies the MIME type to be returned for a file based on the
file suffix.


</dl>

<h2>Security</h2>

By default, JMRI only allows limited access to your computer. 
Only files that are located within the JMRI distribution directory
or the JMRI preferences directory will be provided in response to
requests.  This is not air-tight security, however, and you should
be careful to not put important content in those directories or link
them to other parts of your computer.
