<h1> 
JMRI: Web Access
</h1>

JMRI can provide web access to your model railroad. 

<p>
The basic method was developed by Konrad Froetzheim and colleagues 
in the early 1990's for their "Internet Model Railroad". 
A standard web server communicates with the user's normal web browser, accepting 
HTTP requests in the usual way. 
These requests are handed to a small "JMRI connector", which interprets 
them and returns the information from JMRI back to the browser.

<p>
For example, the user can have their browser request the current 
contents of a JMRI panel, which is 
returned back to the browser as animage to be displayed. 
Or the user can click on the image of a JMRI panel, 
which causes the browser to request a click in the same position on a JMRI panel. 
JMRI acts on that click, 
and also sends back an image of the updated panel.

<h2>Starting Web Access</h2>

JMRI web access is included in the usual JMRI downloads.
To use it, you just have to start it.

<p>
Before attempting to use web access, 
please make sure that the basic configuration of your JMRI application 
is working. 
Check that you can properly communicate with and operate your layout. 

<p>
<img src="images/StartUp.jpg" align="right" height="117" width="312"/>
To start web access from the menus, select "Start Mini Web Server"
under the "Debug" menu. A small window will open to confirm that
it started, and to show you the URL that it's using.

<p>
Next, check the connection. 
Enter the starting URL from the window
(or if you're browsing on the same computer right now, 
<a href="http://localhost:12080/index.html">click here</a>).
You should see a welcome screen.

<p>
Next, let's make sure you can access JMRI functions.
From the JMRI Tools menu select "Power Control", which should open a new window. 
Then click on 
<a href="http://localhost:12080/panel/Power%20Control.html">this link</a> 
or enter the URL 
<code><pre>
http://localhost:12080/panel/Power%20Control.html
</pre></code>
This should display the Power Control window on your web browser. 
(Note: "localhost" is an alias for your 
computer; if you want to access the computer running JMRI from some other computer, 
replace "localhost" 
with the IP address displayed on the main screen, e.g. 
<code><pre>
http://127.0.0.1:12080/panel/Power%20Control.html
</pre></code>
or something similar) 
If everything is working, you should see the Power Control window on your browser screen. 
Click the "On" button to turn layout power on.

<a id="Configure">
<h2>Configuring</h2>

You can use the 
"<a href="../../package/apps/AppConfigPanel.shtml">Advanced Preferences</a>"
to set JMRI to 
start the server each time you start the program.
<p>
To do this, open the preferences window, check the 
"Show Advanced Preferences" box, and 
click "Add Action".  In the new selection box that
appears, select "Start Web Miniserver".  
Don't forget to save your changes!

<p>
There are also more advanced settings that can be configured;
see the links on the sidebar for more information.

<a id="URLs">
<h2>Access URLs</h2>
You can create your own web pages using any tool you'd like. 
To access JMRI from those pages, you just 
need to know how the proper URLs to request the services you'd like. 
Several examples are available in the "web" directory of the distribution. 

<h3>To Display a JMRI Window</h3>

To display the contents of any <i>open</i> JMRI window, use
a URL like:
<code><pre>
<a href="http://localhost:12080/panel/Power%20Control">http://localhost:12080/panel/Power%20Control</a>
</pre></code>
where the last part of the URL is the name
of the desired window.  Note that you have to 
replace spaces by "%20" to make the name a 
valid URL.

<h3>To Display a Clickable JMRI Window</h3>

To display any <i>open</i> JMRI window as a clickable
image that periodically refreshes, use a URL like:
<code><pre>
<a href="http://localhost:12080/panel/Power%20Control.html">http://localhost:12080/panel/Power%20Control.html</a>
</pre></code>
where the last part of the URL is the name
of the desired window.  Note that you have to 
replace spaces by "%20" to make the name a 
valid URL, and that the name ends in ".html".


<h3>To Display a Local File</h3>
A local HTML file (web page), graphic or text file can be 
displayed using the appropriate URL.
<p>
Files in your JMRI preferences directory can be
accessed via a URL that starts with "prefs":
<code><pre>
<a href="http://localhost:12080/prefs/index.html">http://localhost:12080/prefs/index.html</a>
</pre></code>
(The index.html file is in your preferences directory)
<p>
Files in certain directories in the JMRI program directory can be
accessed via a URL that starts with "dist":
<code><pre>
<a href="http://localhost:12080/dist/help/en/webindex.shtml">http://localhost:12080/dist/help/en/webindex.shtml</a>
</pre></code>
will reference the index to the help system, while
<code><pre>
<a href="http://localhost:12080/dist/resources/logo.gif">http://localhost:12080/dist/resources/logo.gif</a>
</pre></code>
will load a JMRI logo graphic from the resources directory.
"dist/web" and "dist/xml" also work as prefixes.
