<H1>JMRI: Defining Your Own Signaling System</H1>

This page describes how to define a new signaling system
to JMRI.  
<p>
We go through creating one from scratch, but 
it's often easier to copy and modify one of the existing 
ones in the 
<a href="http://jmri.org/xml/signals">xml/signals<a>
directory.

<h2>Creating a New Signaling System</h2>

For now, you need to manually create a new directory under
the "xml/signals" directory to hold your new signal definition.
By convention, the name of this directory (e.g. "basic" or
"AAR-1946") provides the system name for your signal defintion.
Think ahead a little bit:  Will there be varients of this
definiton for different eras or different divisions?  If
so, include a year or location in the name, to make it easy
to create modified versions.

<p>
Then, provide these files:
<ul>
<li>index.shtml - Free-form decription of the signal system
<li>aspects.xml - Define the complete set of available aspects
<li>appearance-*.xml - One file for each type of SignalMast, defining
        how to display each aspect.
</ul>

<h3>Create a new index.shtml file</h3>

This is only a description, but it's important to do it first
so that you record the details of what you've done.
<p>
If you're capturing a prototypical system, 
record what you know about it:  The railroad, region/district, year, 
where you found the information, etc.
<p>
If you're making up your own system, describe it in some
detail so that you can come back to it later on and 
remember what you had in mind.  

<h3>Create a new aspects.xml file</h3>

The "name" element at the top of this file provides the user name for your
signaling system, which features prominently in the user interface.
It can be a little more verbose than the directory name, but should
be similar enough that the user can associate them if needed.

<p>
This "aspects" element in this file 
lists <em>all</em> the aspects that can appear in
this signaling system.  (Most model railroads only model one
railroad, so there's only one system present, but it is possible
to use more than one).  You can come back and add more later
if needed, but it's better to enter them all at the beginning
because the names will be more consistent, etc.

<p>
Most of the file is blocks that look like this:
<code><pre>
    &lt;aspect&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;indication&gt;&lt;/indication&gt;
      &lt;description&gt;&lt;/description&gt;
      &lt;reference&gt;&lt;/reference&gt;
      &lt;comment&gt;&lt;/comment&gt;
      &lt;imagelink&gt;&lt;/imagelink&gt;
    &lt;/aspect&gt;
</pre></code>

You have to fill in the name element, but the others are optional.
The title and indication elements can only be included once.
The description, reference and comment elements can be included
as many times as you'd like.  
The imagelink element, if present, should point to
a image file (.gif, .png or .jpg) showing what the family of
appearances looks like.

<h3>Create appearance-*.xml files</h3>

For each kind of signal on the layout (one searchlight,
two searchlight, dwarf, semaphore, etc), you need to
create an appearance file.

<p>
Not every aspect needs to be defined in every file, as
not every type of signal can show every aspect.

<p>
Each aspect that the signal can show needs to be 
described with a block like this:

<code><pre>
    &lt;appearance&gt;
      &lt;aspectname&gt;Clear&lt;/aspectname&gt;
      &lt;show&gt;green&lt;/show&gt;
      &lt;show&gt;red&lt;/show&gt;
      &lt;reference&gt;&lt;/reference&gt;
      &lt;imagelink&gt;&lt;/imagelink&gt;
    &lt;/appearance&gt;
</pre></code>

The "aspectname" needs to be at the start, followed by zero or more
"show" elements. 

<p>
The show element(s) will be used to set the signalheads that
make up the signal properly to display this aspect. There can be zero or more
of these, containing "red", "flash red", "yellow", "flash yellow", "green", "flash green", "lunar", "flash lunar" or "dark".

<p>
You can have as many "reference" elements as you'd like, they're
for user-readable documentation.

<p>
The imagelink element, if present, should point to
a image file (.gif, .png or .jpg) showing what this appearance looks like.

<h3>Check Your Work</h3>

You can use the "Check XML File" and "Validate XML File"
tools under the JMRI "Debug" window to check your files.
The first checks the basic format: Are all the &lt; and &gt; 
characters in the right place? Etc.  The second makes sure that 
the right elements are in the right places, and is a little more
intensive.
