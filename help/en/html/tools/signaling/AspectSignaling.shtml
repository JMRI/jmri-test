<H1>JMRI: Aspect Signaling</H1>
<p class=subtitle>
    Controling signaling in a prototypical manner
</p>

Protoypical signal systems present "aspects" to the engineer
to tell him how to run his train.  Different signals may
show an aspect using different combinations of 
lights, semaphore positions, and/or placards; these are called
"appearances".  For example, the "stop" aspect with be a single red
light on a signal mast with one lamp, red over red lamps for a signal
mast with two lamps, etc.

<h2>Available Signaling Systems</h2>
The available signal system definitions are found in the 
<a href="../../../../../xml/signals">xml/signals</a>
directory.
<dl>
<dt>basic<dd>A non-prototypical set of aspects and appearances that most 
        model railroaders will understand easily.
<dt>AAR-1948<dd>American Association of Railroads 1948 rule book
<dt>SPTCO-1960<dd>Southern Pacific Railway and Transportation Company 1960 rule book
</dl>

<h2>Creating a New Signaling System</h2>

For now, you need to manually create a new directory under
the "xml/signals" directory to hold your new signal definition.
Then, provide these files:
<ul>
<li>index.shtml - Free-form decription of the signal system
<li>aspects.xml - Define the complete set of available aspects
<li>appearance-*.xml - One file for each type of SignalMast, defining
        how to display each aspect.
</ul>
