<H1>JMRI: Aspect Signaling</H1>
<p class=subtitle>
Controling signaling in a prototypical manner

Protoypical signal systems present "aspects" to the engineer
to tell him how to run his train. 
The "Stop" aspect, for example, is pretty simple: Stop the train.  
The "Approach medium" aspect indicates something more complicated:
"Proceed approaching next signal at medium speed".  
Each aspect has an associated "indication", which is usually 
codified in the railroad's rule book.
<p>
Different signals may
show an aspect using different combinations of 
lights, semaphore positions, and/or placards; these are called
"appearances".  For example, the "stop" aspect will be a single red
light on a signal mast with one lamp, red over red lamps for a signal
mast with two lamps, etc.  

<h2>JMRI Support for Aspect Signaling</h2>

The original JMRI support for signals was via
"Signal Heads", which could be set to specific
appearances (colors).
<p>

Starting with JMRI 2.9.1 (early 2010), 
JMRI also contained "Signal Mast" objects that represent an
entire signal, not just an individual head.  A Signal Mast
can operate multiple heads, as required to do full prototypical
signaling based on aspects.

</a>
Signal Masts are configured through the
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastTable.shtml">Signal Mast Table</a>
You add new ones with the "Add..."  button
on the table, which takes you to the
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalMastAddEdit.shtml">"Add Signal Mast" window</a>.

<p>
From the table, you can set individual signal masts to any aspect that they're able to
display by clicking in the "Aspect" column.

<h2>Available Signaling Systems</h2>
The available signal system definitions are found in the 
<a href="../../../../../xml/signals">xml/signals</a>
directory.

        model railroaders will understand easily.

<dt>SPTCO-1960<dd>Southern Pacific Railway and Transportation Company 1960 rule book

There are instructions for creating additional signal system
definitions on
<a href="DefineNewAspects.shtml">a separate page</a>.
