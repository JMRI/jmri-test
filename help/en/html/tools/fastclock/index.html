<H2>Setup Fast Clock
</H2>
    
JMRI provides two kinds of fast clock capability:

<UL>
<LI>Internal - the computers clock provides the time information
<LI>External - the DCC system provides the time information
</UL>

This help page describes the overall structure.  There
is a separate page for 
<a href="LocoNetClock.html">LocoNet clocks</a>.
As yet, we don't have interfaces for clocks in other DCC systems.

<P>
There are two different parts to consider:  A "Timebase" provides the basic
time information, while one or more displays show you what's going on.
<P>
To create a timebase, use the 
"<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/simpleclock/SimpleClockFrame.html">Setup Fast Clock</a>"
 item in the 
"Clocks" submenu under the "Tools" menu.  This gives you a window
where you can:
<UL>
<LI>Select the timebase source to control (typically, this is the internal computer
clock)
<LI>Set the rate at which the clock runs
<LI>Set the time
<LI>Start and stop the clock
</UL>

Once you have created a timebase by configuring it in that window, you 
can open clocks that will display on your screen. Currently, JMRI has three
types available:
<UL>
<LI>Analog clock - the traditional circular clock with hands.  You can resize
it by dragging the window edges.  There's also a pause/run button.
<LI>Nixie clock - a digital clock that looks like the old-style Nixie tubes
<LI>Panel clock - you can also embed a clock in a panel (instead of a separate window)
from the panel editor.
</UL>

Happy timekeeping!
