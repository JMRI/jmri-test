					<P>When a new throttle window is initialized, all function button labels

					closely related to hand-held throttles.  But one of the cool features
					that the JMRI Throttles have to offer over hand-held throttles, is the
					ability to customize the button labels.  In addition, each button can
					be hidden from view or switched to an "unlocked" button.</P>

		<BR>

		<P>By default, the <STRONG>Function Number</STRONG> is associated with the button number that you initially right-clicked on.
		For example, in the figures shown above, function number "1" (F1) is being edited.  It is recommended that you leave this
		number as is, however, you <U>can</U> change this to a different function number if you really wish.  
		An example of why you might want to do this is if you really
		want the "lights" button — which is usually F0 (located as the last/bottom button by default) — to be located as
		the first button in the Function Panel.</P>

		<P class="important">
		<B>Warning! &nbsp; If any modifications are done to the "Function Number" field,
		verify to make sure that no two buttons are assigned the same function number — some unwanted
		consequences may occur.</B>
		</P>

		<P>The <STRONG>Text</STRONG> field will be the most welcome and modified field.  By default, it is set similar to hand-held
		throttles:  F1...F2...F3...etc.  The content of the field is pretty much open to the imagination, however, there is going to
		be a point where the length of the text is <U>not</U> going to fit on the button.  The <STRONG>Font Size</STRONG> field is
		available to also assist in getting the wanted text to fit on the button.  A little experimentation will be required here
		to determine what looks good for you — and what will fit.</P>
				
		<P>The <STRONG>Lockable</STRONG> check box may be a little confusing at first.  When enabled — as it is by default —
		it simply means that when the button is clicked on, it will "lock" itself in either an "on" state
		or an "off" state.  In other words, the button will act as a toggle switch — click once to turn the function "on";
		click again to turn the function "off".  The opposite of this action is what happens when the check box is <B>disabled</B>.
		Then the button acts like a momentary switch — supplying a momentary "on" command for as long as the mouse button is
		clicked <I>and held</I> over the button.  When the mouse button is released, an "off" command is sent to the function.
		A good example of where one might want to use this is when customizing a throttle setup for a sound decoder.  The horn/whistle
		is closer to functional when this option is disabled.  Depending on the speed of the computer system and the DCC system,
		short and quick click and releases would provide a short blast of the horn or whistle.  Holding down the button a little
		longer would produce a longer held blast of the whistle.</P>
				
		<P>The <STRONG>Visible</STRONG> check box allows for the "removal" of unwanted buttons.  By default, all function buttons are
		enabled as "visible" so that they can obviously be seen.  But if there is only a single function being used — for example
		the "lights" (F0) — then this option does provide the ability to "hide" all of the other buttons.</P>

		<P class="important">
		<B>Warning! &nbsp; Disabling the "Visible" check box should be one of the last steps
		performed during this customization process.  The reason for this is that once the button is marked as
		"invisible" (by removing the check box), it is indeed invisible to the user and therefore can't be right-clicked
		on with the mouse in order to get the "Edit Function Button" window back.  To make all buttons visible select "View->Show All Function Buttons."</B>
