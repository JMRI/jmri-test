		<A NAME="HowToFind"></A>
		<H1>Where Do I Find The Throttles?</H1>

		<P>Chances are, if you are reading this text, then you probably saw reference to the
		"throttles" in the JMRI user group postings.  And the first question that probably
		came to your mind was, "where the heck do I find these throttles?"</P>
			
		<P>Well you've started at the right place.  The first thing this section is going
		to do is show you how to gain access to the throttles.  This section will also
		touch on the menu options that are available.</P>
			
		<P>First, it is important to understand that the JMRI Project is a group of many
		"<b>tools</b>" for your railroad — with many contributions from different programmers.  There are four
		primary startup applications available</P>
			
		<UL>
			<LI><B>DecoderPro</B> (the most widely and commonly known piece of the project)
			<LI><B>JMRI Demo</B>
			<LI><B>Loco Tools</B>
			<LI><B>PanelPro</B>
		</UL>
			
		<P>For the purposes of this user guide, the <B>JMRI Demo</B> startup application was used for the
		purposes of writing these pages.  However, you
		will find that many of the tools "cross over" to multiple startup applications.  The <B>Throttle Tool</B>
		is a good example of this.  No matter which of the above mentioned applications you start with, you
		will be able to find the throttles.</P>
		
		<BR><BR><BR><BR>

		<A NAME="MainMenu"></A>
		<H2>The Main (or Primary) Menu</H2>
		
		<DIR>
			<P align="justify">In each of the startup applications noted above, 
			there is always a "<I>primary</I>" main window
			displayed on your screen (similar to that shown below in figure 1-1).  
			Close down this window and the whole application will terminate.  This main
			window contains a primary set of menu options.  
			This is where you will find most of the tools and options
			available — including the Throttles.</P>

			<UL TYPE="square">
				<LI>Click on "<BIG>Tools</BIG>".<BR>
				<LI>This will open a sub-menu.<BR>
				<LI>Navigate your mouse pointer down	until you locate "<BIG>Throttles</BIG>".<BR>
				<LI>This will open another sub-menu.<BR>
				<LI>This is the Throttles Menu (refer to figure 1-2).<BR>

		<DIR>
			<P align="justify">The Throttles sub-menu (as shown in figure 1-2 below) contains the following menu options, which are defined as:</P>

			<UL>
		<LI><B>New Throttle...</B> — opens a single new throttle window
		with default throttle settings enabled.<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<LI><B>Save Throttle Layout...</B> — saves one or more currently
		opened throttle windows to a user-named file on your hard drive.<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<LI><B>Load Throttle Layout...</B> — opens a previously saved
		throttle file. This file can contain one or more throttle windows
		depending on how the layout was originally saved.<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<LI><B>Save Throttle Preferences...</B> - Allows you to set up
		your overall preferences for all throttle windows.
