	    <H1>Introduction: What Is The Throttle Tool</H1>
		
	    <p>The <b>JMRI Throttle Tool</b> is just one of the many digital
		railroading tools that are part of the <b>JMRI Project</b>.  It has the ability
		to run a DCC decoder equipped locomotive around a layout using a computer 
		keyboard and mouse for control instead of a hand-held throttle.  This tool offers
		many of the same common features that can be found on most hand-held throttles,
		including the ability to control light and sound functions.</p>
		
		<p>This user guide 
		was intended to introduce those unfamiliar with the throttle tool.  After reading 
		through the sections identified below, and trying the throttle tool on your own, 
		hopefully it will increase your enjoyment of the DCC model railroading hobby.</p>

		<H1>How To Use This Guide</H1>

		<P>This user guide was set up almost as a training guide. Each section link in the left column 
		is organized like a book.  If you are new to using the throttles, follow each section 
		chapter in sequence and the text will walk you through the process step-by-step — 
		including the opening up of a new throttle layout, customizing it, and then saving 
		all your hard work.</P>
				
		<P>If you have already found the throttle layout tools, but are looking for more 
		information about them,	then hopefully there is a section or two that can also be of help.  
		The list of	chapters and sections will always be available in the left column from
		any page while viewing this guide.  There is also a couple of navigation buttons
		at the bottom of each page.  These will take you to the next or previous chapters; or
		the the main table of contents page (see next paragraph).</P>
		
		<P>In the list of links provided on the left, and located at the conclusion of each chapter page,
		there is a link identified as 
		<a href="ThrottleTOC.shtml" title="Go to the Table Of Contents page"><I><STRONG>TOC</STRONG></I></a>
		or
		<a href="ThrottleTOC.shtml" title="Go to the Table Of Contents page"><I><STRONG>Table Of Contents</STRONG></I></a>.
		This link will take to a dedicated table of contents page.  Some may find it easier to navigate using that page instead.  
		However, the left column does contain all available links that the TOC page contains.</P>

		    <b style="color: #FF0000">Important Note</b>:  Multiple programmers are involved with the code development on this
			project.  Some work on the "front end" of the code (which is
			the interface that you see on your computer screen), and others are
			working on the "back end" of the software for each particular
			DCC system needs.  Although the "front end" should remain constant 
			across all systems, there may be slight differences experienced on 
			your particular DCC system and computer in comparison to what is
			described and shown in this user guide.<BR><BR>
