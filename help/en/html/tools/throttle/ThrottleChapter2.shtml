	    <H1>Open a New Throttle Window</H1>
	
		<P>This chapter will walk you through the process of opening up a new throttle window
		and then configuring it to run a locomotive on your layout.  For the purposes of this
		user guide, we will be using a locomotive that has been equipped with a sound decoder.
		The decoder's address in our examples here is <B>8251</B>.  If you are following along
		with a locomotive of your own while you read this, simply replace your loco's decoder
		address anywhere that "8251" is shown.</P>
			
		<P>So let's get started.</P>

		<P>Now that we have successfully opened up the throttle window, the next thing we need to do is

		a locomotive's decoder address.  Please note in Figure 2-2 above that all of the panels are pretty much
		disabled.  This is because there is no address assigned yet.  After establishing an address, the

						<P>Now that you have established an address for the throttle, you should be able

						entered is valid to a locomotive on the track).  You do this using the
						"<B>Control Panel</B>" (see Figure 2-5).  But here is where things get a
						little sticky.</P>
								
						<P>There are multiple combinations of DCC systems and computer platforms that
						make up for slight differences in the functionality of the throttles.
						The programmers are working hard at trying to get these throttles to function
						identically.  But because of the these differences, you may discover that not
						everything noted in the following text will function as defined for your system.</P>

						<P class="important">
						<B>Important!</B> &nbsp; 
						The "Control Panel" must have the "focus" for it to become
						active (and usable).  In other words, it's window bar must be active.  If
						you are following along with this text with your own locomotive and just
						entered an address in the Address Panel, you will discover that the Address
						Panel is the window with the current focus.  None of the keyboard or mouse
						actions described below will move the train until the Control Panel has the
						focus.  To make the Control Panel the active window, use your mouse pointer
						to click somewhere within the Control Panel.

		    <P>When the decoder address is first "<BIG>Set</BIG>", the software queries the current
			status of the decoder.  This includes the current direction of the locomotive, its current
			speed, and what function buttons are on or off.  The software will set the current
			direction indicator and identify any functions that are "active" (in the "on" state).
			But, if the loco is moving, the loco's speed is not established on the Speed Control
			slider bar.</P>
							
			<P class="important">
			<B>Note:</B> &nbsp; At this time, the slider bar does <U>not</U> automatically correspond
			to the actual speed.  This is important to understand because of what action you are
			going to see when you first click on the speed slider bar.  When you first "<BIG>Set</BIG>"
			a decoder address, the slider bar is set to the zero (0) position.  So if you acquired
			a locomotive that is actually moving and you click on the slider bar, it is going to set
			the speed to zero (or wherever you click and set the slider bar pointer).<BR><BR>

						<P>The Function Panel has 13 function buttons available for each throttle window.  Most
						decoders currently don't handle 13 functions.  (If there are any, please let me know.)
						But the software is prepared for the future.  Some of the more newer hand-held throttles
						also have 13 function buttons (including the lights), so these electronic throttles follow
						these newer hand-helds.</P>
					
						<P>Clicking on the function buttons correlate to pressing the same function button on a
						hand-held throttle.  The F0 function is normally used for the lights.</P>
					
						<P>This is the basic functionality of the Function Panel.  All buttons function like an
						on/off toggle — click once to turn "on"; click again to turn "off".</P>
					
						<P>The next chapter provides more advanced features for customizing the Function Panel
						buttons.</P>
