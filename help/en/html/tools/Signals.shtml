		JMRI: Signal Head Documentation
        </H1>

Signals (or more formally Signal Heads) are how JMRI represents and 
controls signal heads on a layout.  They are a specific kind of
output device that can be set to various colors:  Red, Yellow, Green, Flashing Yellow, etc.

<p>
Much more information about JMRI signaling is available
from the 
<a href="signaling/index.shtml">JMRI signaling help page</a>.

All the signal heads that JMRI knows about can be referenced
using the "Signal Head Table" tool in the Tools menu of JMRI programs.
<p>
For more information on configuring and operating signals with the Signal Head
Table, please see the 
<a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalHeadTable.shtml">Signal Head Table help page</a>.

<P>To define a new signal head, click on the <b>Add New Signal Head</b> button in the Signal Head Table.  
It will
prompt you for the signal head type (controlled by turnout outputs; SE8c; etc), and
whatever setup information is needed for your choice.
There's more information on the
<a href="../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalAddEdit.shtml">help page on adding signal heads</a>.

<a name="edit"><h3>Editing an Existing Signal Head</h3>

<P>Once a signal head has been defined, you currently can't change
it's type directly from the program.  
This is a requested
capability, and someday somebody will probably write it.
In the meantime, you can just ignore signal heads that you've defined 
and don't want to use; they don't hurt anything.
Or you can edit your saved configuration files to remove the entire
line containing the signal definition; look for the name of the signal
to locate the right line.  Note that you need to remove the entire line, and
not leave any part of it, especially the opening and closing brackets. Save
a copy of the file as a backup first!

<h3>Controlling a Signal Head</h3>

Signal heads can be controlled various ways by JMRI, including
<ul>
<LI><a href="signaling/index.shtml">Simple Signal Logic</a>, for basic ABS signaling of the North American type
<li><a href="Logix.shtml">Logix</a>, a graphical way of controlling signal heads with simple logic
<li>JMRI <a href="scripting/index.shtml">scripts</a>, using a full programming language to do whatever you'd like
</UL>

<h2>Saving and Reloading Configuration</h2>

The signal head information is saved with the configuration in an XML file, along
with control panel setup and similar stuff.  For more information
on creating and displaying panels, including how to show signal heads
on your panels,
please see the 
<A HREF="../apps/PanelPro/Panels.html">Panels pages</a>.
