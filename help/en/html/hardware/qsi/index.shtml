<h2> 
JMRI: QSI Programmer
</h2>

<em>This page describes QSI support that first became available
in JMRI version 2.1.5.  Previous versions of JMRI do not contain it.</em><p>

JMRI can now use a QSI Programmer module
to read and write CVs in DCC decoders.

<p>
JMRI cannot (yet) download sounds to QSI decoders.

<p>
Note that when using JMRI with the QSI Programmer,
the Quantum CV Manager program must <em>not</em>
be running. If it is, you'll get obscure errors and JMRI won't be
able to access the decoder.

<h2>Driver Installation</h2>

To access the QSI Programmer, you need to install a driver on your
computer.  This section describes how to do that for several popular
computer types.

<a id="driverWin">
<h3>Windows</h3>

<em>This is still being worked on.</em>
<p>
For JMRI to talk to the QSI Programmer, drivers have to be installed
so that the QSI Programmer appears to be a serial port (a Virtual Comm Port, or
VCP).  These drivers are different from the ones that the QSI software uses, so
have to be downloaded and installed separately.
<p>
There are drivers available from the
<a href="http://www.silabs.com/tgwWebApp/public/web_content/products/Microcontrollers/en/MCU_Downloads.htm">SiLabs web site</a>.
<p>
Unfortunately, we have not yet managed to get all those pieces 
together in the right way to make this work.  If you'd like
to work on this, it would be greatly appreciated.

<a id="driverMac">
<h3>Mac OS X</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download the 
<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/corby-osx-V1_04_1-release.dmg">installation file</a>
for the Mac OS X driver.
This is a disk image (.dmg) file that should open
as a new Finder window. If not, double click on it.
<li>
Double-click on the installer and follow the directions.
<li>
Restart your computer.
</ol>
You should now be able to start a JMRI application
and access the QSI Programmer.  It will appear as
"QSI Programmer" in the preferences windows.

<a id="driverLinux">
<h3>Linux</h3>

<em>This is still being worked on.</em>

<ol>
<li>Download the 
<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/cornwall-redhat9-V0_84.tar">installation file</a>
for the Linux driver.
This is a .tar archive file.
<li>
Expand the archive to somewhere convenient, and change directory to there.
<li>
Try running the installer via either
<code><pre>
./load_qsi_prog
</pre></code>
or
<code><pre>
sudo ./load_qsi_prog
</pre></code>
</ol>

<h2>Configure the QSI Programmer Support</h2>

You configure JMRI to use a QSI Programmer similarly to the
way all other connection types are configured.

<ol>
<li>
Start the program
<li>
Select the "Preferences..." item from the "Edit" menu on the main window.
<li>
Select "QSI Programmer" as the connection type.
<li>
Select "QSIProgrammer" as the port to use.
<li>
The rest of the options are fixed, and can't be changed.
<li>
Click the "Save" button. When prompted, allow the program to quit.
</ol>

The program is now configured. Restart it, and it should be ready to use.
