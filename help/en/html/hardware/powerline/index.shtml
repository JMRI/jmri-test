<h2> 
JMRI:  Powerline Controllers
</h2>

This page talks about how to configure JMRI to talk
to powerline controllers, e.g. X10. 

<p>
JMRI support for the X10 CM11 adapter
became available in JMRI 2.1.2.

<p>
See also the associated
<a href="Compatibility.shtml">compatibility page</a> to see what interfaces
have been supported.

<p>
Currently we are using the X10 CM11A serial device as our test implementation.
Once that is working, we expect to add other X10 interfaces.
Eventually the Insteon device family will be supported once we have a developer
who buys one of those interfaces.

<p>
For information on how to address your equipment via JMRI, please
see the 
<a href="Names.shtml">page on addressing and JMRI names</a>.

<p>
JMRI Lights work intuitively with powerline devices.  When the JMRI
Light is set "ON", a command is send to the remote device to set it "ON".
Ditto for "OFF".  Note that X10 controls the rate at which the brightness
is changed, and what happens at the remote end.

<p>
JMRI Turnouts are available for X10.  When the JMRI Turnout
is set to "THROWN", a command is sent to the remote device to 
set it to "BRIGHT".  This is an immediate, full-power on.  When the Turnout
is set to "CLOSED", the remote device is sent a command to go "OFF".  Depending
on the X10 hardware, this may be either an immediate off, or be slowly dimmed.
