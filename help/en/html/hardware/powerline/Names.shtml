<h1> 
JMRI: Powerline System Names
</h1>

Individual inputs (Sensors)  and outputs (Turnouts and Lights)
in JMRI are accessed via names.  
For information on the general scheme, please see
the 
<a href="../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">naming page</a>
in the
<a href="../../doc/Technical/index.shtml">technical documentation</a>.

<h2>X10</h2>

X10 devices are addressed via a "House Code" of A through P, 
and a "Device Code" of 1 through 16.

<p>
JMRI configures the adapter to use House Code "A" now.
We'll eventually make that configuable, but for now
that means that input messages will only be received
from devices set to house code A.

<p>
Outputs (Lights or Turnouts) in house code A 
are numbered with their 
device code, e.g. PT1 is device 1, PT2 is device 2, etc.

<p>
Inputs (Sensors) are identified by the house code and device number
that was reported by some other X10 device like a motion sensor or
light control pad.
NOTE: due to a large number of false codes due to other X10 users
sensors are not automaticly generated.
They must be entered in the sensor table by the user.

<p>For example:

<ul>
<li>PTB3 - Device 3 on housecode B, the same as PT19
<li>PLA12 - Device 12 on housecode A, the same as PL12
<li>PTC02 - Device 2 on housecode C, the same as PT34
<li>PSA4 - Device 4 on housecode A, reported an on or off from some other X10 device.
</ul>

<p>
If an output is called as a turnout, you only get on and off
for output options.

<p>
An output that is used as a light will take variable intensities.
However, some physical X10 devices may not support dimming.

<h2>Insteon (currently planned, not implemented)</h2>

Insteon adapters are labelled with a four-part number that looks
like 01.2A.B4.CD, four bytes in hexadecimal.  These are just random
strings as part as the user and the program is concerned, and
we don't make any effort to subdivide them.  We will accept 
dropping of leading zeros (e.g. 01 and 1 can be used in a group, so
both 1.2.3.4 and 01.02.03.4 are accepted). We also accept either lower
case or upper case letters.  Extra zeros, e.g. numbers beyond 
two digits, are not accepted.  Note that .23. is a hexadecimal 23, 
decimal 19.  Entry of addresses in decimal form it not (yet) available.
