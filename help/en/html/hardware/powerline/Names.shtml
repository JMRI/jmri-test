<h1> 
JMRI: Powerline System Names
</h1>

Individual inputs (Sensors)  and outputs (Turnouts and Lights)
in JMRI are accessed via names.  
For information on the general scheme, please see
the 
<a href="../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">naming page</a>
in the
<a href="../../doc/Technical/index.shtml">technical documentation</a>.

<h2>X10</h2>

X10 devices are addressed via a "House Code" of A through P, 
and a "Device Code" of 1 through 16.

<p>
JMRI configures the adapter to use House Code "A" now.
We'll eventually make that configuable, but for now
that means that input messages will only be received
from devices set to house code A.

<p>
Outputs (Lights and Turnouts) in house code A 
are numbered with their 
device code, e.g. PT1 is device 1, PT2 is device 2, etc.

<p>
Depending on your setup, you might be able to access other housecodes
by adding "16"s to the number, e.g. PT17 is device 1 in housecode B,
etc. 

<table border="1">
<tr><th>House code</th><th>Offset</th><th>Device 1</th><th>Device 16</th></tr>
<tr><td>A</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>16</td></tr>
<tr><td>B</td><td>16</td><td>17</td><td>32</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>32</td><td>33</td><td>48</td></tr>
<tr><td>D</td><td>48</td><td>49</td><td>64</td></tr>
<tr><td>E</td><td>64</td><td>65</td><td>80</td></tr>
<tr><td>F</td><td>80</td><td>81</td><td>96</td></tr>
<tr><td>G</td><td>96</td><td>97</td><td>112</td></tr>
<tr><td>H</td><td>112</td><td>112</td><td>128</td></tr>
<tr><td>I</td><td>128</td><td>129</td><td>144</td></tr>
<tr><td>J</td><td>144</td><td>145</td><td>160</td></tr>
<tr><td>K</td><td>160</td><td>161</td><td>176</td></tr>
<tr><td>L</td><td>176</td><td>177</td><td>192</td></tr>
<tr><td>M</td><td>192</td><td>193</td><td>208</td></tr>
<tr><td>N</td><td>208</td><td>209</td><td>224</td></tr>
<tr><td>O</td><td>224</td><td>225</td><td>240</td></tr>
<tr><td>P</td><td>240</td><td>241</td><td>256</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Eventually, it will be possible to use a letter-number combination
to address X10 devices.  For example:
<ul>
<li>PTB3 - Device 3 on housecode B, the same as PT19
<li>PLA12 - Device 12 on housecode A, the same as PL12
<li>PTC02 - Device 2 on housecode C, the same as PT34
</ul>
This code has not yet been written, though.

<h2>Insteon</h2>

Insteon adapters are labelled with a four-part number that looks
like 01.2A.B4.CD, four bytes in hexadecimal.  These are just random
strings as part as the user and the program is concerned, and
we don't make any effort to subdivide them.  We will accept 
dropping of leading zeros (e.g. 01 and 1 can be used in a group, so
both 1.2.3.4 and 01.02.03.4 are accepted). We also accept either lower
case or upper case letters.  Extra zeros, e.g. numbers beyond 
two digits, are not accepted.  Note that .23. is a hexadecimal 23, 
decimal 19.  Entry of addresses in decimal form it not (yet) available.
