JMRI: ESU ECoS Support
</h1>
JMRI can connect to an ESU ECoS command station 
via an Internet connection.

<p>
To configure the connection:
<ul>
<li>Open the JMRI "Preferences" under the "Edit" menu,
<li>Select "ESU ECoS" as the connection type,
<li>Enter the IP address for your ECoS unit,
<li>Leave the port number at 15471,
<li>Click "Save".
</ul>

<p>
Initially, only turnout, a basic throttle and power support is available for 
a JMRI-connected ECoS unit.

<p>
<H2>Turnouts</H2>
ECoS-connected turnouts have names like "UT123", where "U"
is the system name for esU ecos, "T" means turnout, and
"123" is the address.

<p>
<H2>Throttles</H2>
Only basic support for throttles via the Ecos is supported.  When an entry from the roster, or a DCC address is directly
entered into the address field, JMRI will check the existing list of ECoS locos for a match on the first DCC address it comes across.
If there is no match, the throttle will create an entry in the Ecos which will be listed as "Created By JMRI" with a default of 128 speed steps.
When you release the loco or close the throttle the entry is currently left in the Ecos.


<p>
<H2>Ecos Initialisation</H2>
When JMRI first starts up, it reads the turnout and loco information
from the ECoS, which might take a couple seconds.

<p>
Additional information on the ECoS can be found
on the 
<a href="http://www.loksound.de/us/index.php?showId=205">ESU web site</a>.

<p>
Support for ECoS was first available in 
<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/releasenotes/jmri2.3.3.shtml">JMRI 2.3.3</a>.

Support for the ECoS throttle was first available in 
<a href="http://jmri.sf.net/releasenotes/jmri2.7.4.shtml">JMRI 2.7.4</a>.
