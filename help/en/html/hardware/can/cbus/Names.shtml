<h1> 
JMRI: CBUS Naming
</h1>

This page discusses how JMRI uses system names
to access CBUS-attached resources.

<p>
For more on JMRI's CBUS support, see the
<a href="index.shtml">main CBUS page</a>.

<h2>JMRI's Use of Names</h2>
JMRI provides an interface to the real layout via 
internal objects such as Turnouts, Sensors, etc that
are closely mapped to corresponding physical devices.
This mapping is done via "System Names", which both 
identify the how to access a particular device, and
ar ethe key to looking up the corresponding object in JMRI.

<p>
Two examples will perhaps explain this best.

<p>
A DCC system uses "accessory decoders" to control e.g. turnouts on
the layout.  These have addresses like 123, 45, and other small
numbers.  If you dial the proper number into a handheld throttle,
you can control the accessory decoder and hence the turnout on the layout.
In JMRI, you access the accessory decoder via a Turnout object, and you 
provide the needed address as part of the system name when requesting
that Turnout.  "LT123" is a "T"urnout, accessed via the attached
"L"oconet system, using address "123".  

<p>
Some layout control systems have more complicated addressing.
For example, C/MRI addressing involves a node number and a bit number on 
a specific node.  JMRI handles this via a system-specific structure
within the system name used to reference C/MRI-connected objects.
For example,
CT12034 is a "T"urnout
on a "C"/MRI system, with bit address "034" on node "12".

<h2>CBUS Events</h2>

<a href="http://www.merg.org.uk/">MERG</a>
<a href="http://www.merg.org.uk/resources/lcb.html">CBUS</a>
communicates via messages with a fixed format:  
One byte of command and length information, followed optionally
by additional data bytes.  
In it's most simple form, this is used to send indentifiable
"events".  In turn, events come in two types:  "ON" and "OFF".
