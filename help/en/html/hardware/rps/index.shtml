      JMRI Hardware Guide: NAC Services RPS
      </h1>

	<h2>Supported Systems</h2>

    (To be written)
    	  
	<h2>Setup</h2>

	  <p>First, connect your computer's serial port to the RPS
	  central unit using a serial cable.  This should be a "straight-through"
	  or "modem" cable, <I>not</I>a "crossover" or "null-modem" cable.
	  if your computer doesn't have a built-in serial port, you can
	  use a USB-serial adapter, but make sure you install the correct
	  drivers.

      <P>
      Next, configure the program.
      <UL>
      <LI>Start your JMRI-based program (DecoderPro, PanelPro, etc).
	  <li> Go to the preferences panel of the program.
	  This opens automatically the first time a program is run, or you
	  can select it from the "Edit" menu.

      <li>Configure your DCC connection in the top section
      
      <li>Click "Show advanced preferences" to open a new 
      part of the preferences window.
      
	  <li>Select "RPS Base Station" from the "Aux connection 2"
	  selection box.
	  
	  <LI>In the associated port selection box, pick the name of the 
	  serial port that you have connected to the RPS system.</li>

	  <li>The baud rate will show a fixed value of
	  115200 baud.

	  <li>Click "Save".  You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to
	  quit, click "Yes".

	  <li> Restart the program. It should come up saying it's connected
	  to your DCC system, and just below that saying it's connected to
	  the RPS Base Station on the proper port. 
	  
	  <li>Next, you have to enter alignment information.
	  From the RPS menu, select "Receiver Control". This will 
	  open a new window.  
	  
	  <li>In the middle of that window, enter the number of
	  highest-numbered receiver you've got. 
	  Press the "Set" button next to that field.
	  
	  <li>In the table at the top, enter the X, Y and Z position of
	  each of your receivers.  If you don't have a 
	  receiver with a particular number, leave that row blank.
	  
	  <li>Click the "Store" button to save these positions as default values.
	  </ul>
    
    At this point, your RPS system is ready to go.
    <p>
    To have your RPS system start measuring positions, you have to
    tell it to poll the locomotives in which you've installed 
    RPS transmitters. To do this:
    <ul>
        <li>Open the "Polling Control" from the RPS menu
        <li>You should see all of the locomotives in your roster
        <li>Check the box under "Poll" for each 
            locomotive in which a RPS transmitted is installed
        <li>Check the "poll" box to start making measurements
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    To see that the system is working, open the "Debugging Display"
    from the RPS menu.  You should see time readins coming
    in and being converted to positions.  You can also check the
    communications with the unit by opening the "RPS Monitor"
    from the RPS menu.

	<h2>Features and Limitations</h2>

    (Not yet complete)
    
    <h2>RPS Tools</h2>
    
    JMRI provides a number of tools in the RPS menu for 
    working with the RPS system:
    <dl>
    <dt><a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rps/aligntable/AlignTableFrame.shtml">Receiver Control</a>
    <dd>This is where you enter position information about your receiver
    positions, etc.
    
    <dt><a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rps/swing/polling/PollTableFrame.shtml">Polling Control</a>
    <dd>This is where you tell JMRI which locomotives have RPS 
    transmitters, and how often you want JMRI to poll them
    
    <dt><a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/rps/swing/debugger/DebuggerFrame.shtml">Debug Display</a>
    <dd>This shows you the readings and measurements as the system makes them
    
    <dt>Tracking Display
    <dd>This shows the points as they are measured on a graphical display
    </dl>
    
    <h2>For More Information</h2>
    
    There's more information available on the 
    <a href="http://www.nacservicesinc.com/">NAC Services Web Site</a>.
