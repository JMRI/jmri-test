The Digitrax PR3 can be used as either a standalone
decoder programmer much like the PR2, or as an 
interface between your computer and a LocoNet, much
like an MS100. It can only do one or the other 
of these at a given time.

<p>
When the PR3 is acting as a programmer, it can be used
to set CVs in all decoders that DecoderPro supports.
It can also be used to download sound information into
Digitrax sound decoders and, within its limited current
capability, run one locomotive to test it.

<p>
When acting as an interface, the PR3 allows JMRI full control of the 
LocoNet and the devices attached to it.  

<p>
You select the default mode in the preferences, and the
"<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/loconet/pr3/swing/Pr3Select.shtml">Select PR3 Mode</a>"
tool in the LocoNet menu lets you change the mode during operation.

<p>
For more information on the PR3 itself, please see the
<a href="http://digitrax.com/prd_compint_pr3.php">Digitrax PR3 page</a>
and the 
<a href="http://www.digitrax.com/kb/index.php?c=338">PR3 page</a>
in the 
<a href="http://www.digitrax.com/kb/index.php">Digitrax Knowledge Base</a>.


<h2>Using the PR3 as a LocoNet Interface</h2>

<h2>Using the PR3 Programming Track</h2>

<p>
To use the PR3 programming track, 
connect the PR3 to its power supply and to a 
dedicated piece of track which you'll use as the programming track.
Also, connect a USB cable between the PR3 and your computer.

<h3>Recommended setup</h3>
<p>
To set up DecoderPro to use the PR3:
</p>

<UL>
<LI>
Start DecoderPro.
<li>
Open the Preferences window from the Edit menu and configure the connection by:
<UL>
<LI>Select LocoNet PR3
<LI>Select the serial port that's connected to the PR3
<li>The speed will be fixed at 57,600 baud; don't try to change this 
in your computer's settings
<li>The "Flow Control" option defaults to "Use Hardware Flow Control", which
uses the status leads in the serial connection to determine when the PR3
is ready to send and receive.  You should try that first, as it is the most
reliable mode.  
Only if you can't program decoders using that choice, 
and only after checking that you're using the right port, should you select "None" for 
this preference and try again.
</UL>
<li>Click Save at the bottom of the preferences window, quit the program and restart.
</UL>

<h3>Usage suggestions</h3>

<P> 
You can use a JMRI throttle to control the locomotive connected
to the PR3. Use the JMRI Power Control or the "Power" menu item 
on the Throttle's menu bar to turn on track power, and then you 
can operate the locomotive normally.  

<p>The PR3 can only
provide very limited current, so Digitrax has built a "neutral mode"
into their sound decoders.  When JMRI and the PR3 is running
a Digitrax sound decoder, the motor is disconnected to reduce the current load.
You can still ramp the speed up and down with the throttle and listen to
how the sound responds, but the motor won't move the locomotive.

<p>
Other decoders, including decoders from other manufacturers, may 
draw enough motor current to trip the PR3 internal circuit breakers.
This will cause JMRI to mark track power as "off". Just wait a couple
seconds and turn the track power back on to recover.
