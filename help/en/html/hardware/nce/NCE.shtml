<H2>NCE</H2>

<P>JMRI supports three NCE layout connections, PowerHouse via serial
cable, PowerHouse via network connection, and NCE USB adapter via serial cable. They
are shown in the preferences menu as NCE, NCE via network, and NCE USB
respectively.

<a id="phpro"></a>
<H3>PowerHouse Pro</H3>
This section discusses JMRI's support for the NCE PowerHouse Pro.

<H4>Setup</H4>

<OL>
	<LI>To connect your computer to an NCE Powerhouse Pro system, you can usually
	just connect the command station to the computer's serial port using a
	9-pin serial cable.</LI>
	<LI>Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program. This
	opens automatically the first time a program is run, or you can select
	it from the "Edit" menu.</LI>
	<LI>Select "NCE" from the top selection box. You can then select
	the proper serial port in the second selection box.</LI>
	<LI>If given the option to select a baud rate choose 9600 which is the default for NCE.
	If that selection is fixed (due to using an older
	EPROM), don't worry.</LI>
	<LI>Now confirm that the baud rate in the NCE command station is the
	same. Use a ProCab to select "Set Cmd Sta" by pressing the Prog/Esc
	button 5 times. Then press the Enter button 15 times to select baud
	rates. Finally, select a baud rate (#1 is 9600 and #2 is 19,200 baud), and press esc
	to exit.</LI>
	<LI>The series of radio buttons labelled "GUI style" allows you to
	select how the program will look. "Metal" is the native Java look
	available on all types. Other choices will vary with your computer
	type. "Motif", "Windows", "MacOS" and "MacOS Adaptive" look native on
	Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic" and MacOS X respectively.</LI>
	<LI>In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default
	programmer format. You can override this each time you open the
	programmer, so this is here just for convenience.</LI>
	<LI>Click "Save". You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to
	quit, click "Yes".</LI>
	<LI>Restart the program. You should be up and running.</LI>
</OL>
<P>For reliable operation, we recommend that you disable "AIU
broadcast", and set the baud rate to 9600. These are the normal defaults
for NCE. Both of these parameters can be found in your NCE user's manual
under "Setup Command Station".</P>

<H4>EPROM Versions</H4>

<P>The NCE Powerhouse Pro command station uses an "EPROM" to contain
it's software. NCE has made several of these available to it's users.
JMRI has been updated to work with these as they come out. To determine
which ROM version you have, go to the 'setup command station' menu on
the ProCab. The first screen will show you the EPROM version currently
installed.</P>
<UL>
	<LI>December 2004 EPROM - JMRI 1.6.1 or any JMRI 1.7 version or
	later should work fine.</LI>
	<LI>2007 EPROM - you need JMRI 1.7.6 or later.</LI>
	<LI>Various "beta test" versions from early 2006 - ask NCE to send
	you an update to the 2007 EPROM, then use JMRI 1.7.6 or later</LI>
</UL>

<P>If you wish to use MONITORING for turnout feedback, you must
upgrade your command station to the Mar 1 2007A EPROM or newer. The
release in the first half of 2007 had a problem with odd turnout status.
Every other odd accessory shared the same status bit. JMRI checks the
revision number at startup, and will send a warning to the console
window if it finds the early 2007 EPROM. If you're not sure if you have
the latest, you can perform a simple test. First normal accessory 1 and
5 using the "Select Accy" button on your ProCab. Then using the "Select
Accy" button, change accessory 1 to REV. Then check accessory 5, and if
NOW = REV for accessory 5, you have the earlier revision with the known
problem. If you have the early 2007 EPROM and wish to use MONITORING for
feedback, contact NCE for an EPROM upgrade.</P>

<a id="AIU"></a>
<H4>AIU Numbering</H4>
The NCE "AIU" device allows the NCE command station to check the status
of inputs from the layout. These are referenced in JMRI as "Sensors"
with names like "NS785". "NS" means "NCE Sensor", and 785 is the number
of a specific sensor input.
<P>The sensor number can be found by using the following formula:</P>
<P>Sensor ID = (AIU Cab Address - 1) * 16 + (Pin Number On AIU) -1</P>
<P>For example: The AIU cab address is set to 50 and one of the
BD20s is connected to pin 2. Therefore the Sensor ID would be:</P>
<P>Sensor ID = (50 - 1) * 16 + (2) -1</P>
<P>Sensor ID = 785</P>

<H4>Limitations</H4>

<P>A very small number of early NCE Powerhouse Pro command stations
have an "optional analog control circuit". (If you don't recall special
ordering this, you probably don't need to read the rest of this
paragraph!) In these, pins 5, 6, and 9 are used with an analog voltage
as a separate throttle. If you have one of these command stations, a
normal 9-pin serial cable will not work! You'll need to make a custom
cable that just connects the "send data", "receive data" and "ground"
pins. See your NCE manual for details.</P>

<H3>NCE USB Adapter</H3>

<IMG src="../images/nceUSB.jpg" width="37" height="50" alt="NCE USB"/></a></dt>

<P>The NCE USB Adapter can be connected to three NCE systems, PowerCab, SB3
(SmartBooster) or PowerHouse. You must select the correct system from
the preference menu for reliable operation.</P>


<H4>NCE USB Adapter Limitations</H4>

<P>The NCE USB Adapter doesn't support all of the current JMRI features and
functions. Some of the restrictions are based on the type of system
the USB Adapter is connected to. The USB can't get information from AIUs, so
they can't be used to get feedback from the layout. The turnout feedback
mode MONITORING isn't available when using a USB, and the Clock
functions found in tools are also not available. The USB when connected
to a PowerHouse system doesn't support any type of loco programming, and
when connected to a SB3 only operation mode (no program track) is
available for loco programming. Most functions and features that are not
supported by the NCE USB are disabled or grayed out in the JMRI program.</P>

<P>The USB Adapter when connected to a PowerCab or SB3 can only address
accessories (turnouts) between 1 and 250. There isn't a limitation when
connected to a PowerHouse.</P>
