<P>For reliable operation, we recommend that you disable AIU
broadcast, and set the baud rate to 9600. These are the normal defaults
for NCE. Both of these parameters can be found in your NCE user's manual
under "Setup Command Station".</P>

<P>If you wish to use MONITORING for turnout feedback, you must
upgrade your command station to the Mar 1 2007A EPROM or newer. The
release in the first half of 2007 had a problem with odd turnout status.
Every other odd accessory shared the same status bit. JMRI checks the
revision number at startup, and will send a warning to the console
window if it finds the early 2007 EPROM. If you're not sure if you have
the latest, you can perform a simple test. First normal accessory 1 and
5 using the "Select Accy" button on your ProCab. Then using the "Select
Accy" button, change accessory 1 to REV. Then check accessory 5, and if
NOW = REV for accessory 5, you have the earlier revision with the known
problem. If you have the early 2007 EPROM and wish to use MONITORING for 
feedback, contact NCE for an EPROM upgrade.</P>
