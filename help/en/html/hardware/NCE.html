<H2>NCE</H2>

<P>JMRI supports three NCE layout connections, PowerHouse via serial
cable, PowerHouse via network connection, and USB via serial cable. They
are shown in the preferences menu as NCE, NCE via network, and NCE USB
respectively.</P>

<H3>PowerHouse</H3>

<P>For reliable operation, we recommend that you disable AIU
broadcast, and set the baud rate to 9600. These are the normal defaults
for NCE. Both of these parameters can be found in your NCE user's manual
under "Setup Command Station".</P>

<P>If you wish to use MONITORING for turnout feedback, you must
upgrade your command station to the Mar 1 2007A EPROM or newer. The
release in the first half of 2007 had a problem with odd turnout status.
Every other odd accessory shared the same status bit. JMRI checks the
revision number at startup, and will send a warning to the console
window if it finds the early 2007 EPROM. If you're not sure if you have
the latest, you can perform a simple test. First normal accessory 1 and
5 using the "Select Accy" button on your ProCab. Then using the "Select
Accy" button, change accessory 1 to REV. Then check accessory 5, and if
NOW = REV for accessory 5, you have the earlier revision with the known
problem. If you have the early 2007 EPROM and wish to use MONITORING for
feedback, contact NCE for an EPROM upgrade.</P>

<H3>USB</H3>

<P>The NCE USB can be connected to three NCE systems, PowerCab, SB3
(SmartBooster) or PowerHouse. You must select the correct system from
the preference menu for reliable operation.</P>


<H3>USB Limitations</H3>

<P>The NCE USB doesn't support all of the current JMRI features and
functions. The some of the restrictions are based on the type of system
the USB is connected to. The USB can't get information from AIUs, so
they can't be used to get feedback from the layout. The turnout feedback
mode MONITORING isn't available when using a USB, and the Clock
functions found in tools are also not available. The USB when connected
to a PowerHouse system doesn't support any type of loco programming, and
when connected to a SB3 only operation mode (no program track) is
available for loco programming. Most functions and features that are not
supported by the NCE USB are disabled or grayed out in the JMRI program.</P>

<P>The USB when connected to a PowerCab or SB3 can only address
accessories (turnouts) between 1 and 250. There isn't a limitation when
connected to a PowerHouse.</P>
