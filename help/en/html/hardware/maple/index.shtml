<a href="http://www.maplesystems.com/">Maple Systems</a>
makes several series of 
<a href="http://www.maplesystems.com/products/silverseries/silverseries_ezw.htm">touchscreen panels</a> 
that can be very useful on model railroads.

<p>
Each panel is really a standalone computer.
It's configured and loaded using a 
<a href="http://www.maplesystems.com/products/software/ezware.htm">configuration program</a>
provided by Maple Systems.
That configuration defines the displays, button labels and locations, etc.

<p>
JMRI interacts with the panel through input and output bits 
(called "coils", as in relay coils)
within the panel.
The panel configuration can set these in response to various events.
JMRI provides Sensor objects that make them available for triggering actions
within JMRI.
JMRI can defines Turnout objects which can set them, in which case the
panel configuration can change what's being displayed.

<p>
This is still in the very early stages, so details are changing rapidly.
If you want to use these devices, please contact the JMRI developers.
