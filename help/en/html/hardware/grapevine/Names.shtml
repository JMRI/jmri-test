<h2> 
JMRI: Grapevine System Names
</h2>

Individual inputs (Sensors)  and outputs (Turnouts and Lights)
in JMRI are accessed via names.  
For information on the general scheme, please see
the 
<a href="../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">naming page</a>
in the
<a href="../../doc/Technical/index.shtml">technical documentation</a>.

<p>
For Grapevine systems, all names start with a system letter of "G".
After that, there's a 
<a href="../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml#type">type letter</a>,
then a node number and a pin number.

<p>
Each Grapevine node has a number, from 1 to 127.

<p>
The pin number, from 001 up, defines the specific input or output 
connection on the node. Note that a pin number is always three digits.

<p>
For example, the 1st Grapevine Sensor input pin on node 23 would be
named GS23001.  The 5th Turnout on node 2 would be GT2005. 

<p>
If it's helpful, you can think of the node number as being the "thousands"
part of the combined number, and the pin number as the lower three digits.

<h3>Inputs</h3>

Grapevine nodes have a number of possible inputs:
<dl>
 <dt>
    Parallel Inputs
 </dt><dd>
    There are eight three-pin connectors on a Grapevine node
    that can be used as general inputs.  These Sensors are 
    referenced as 001 to 008.
    <p>
    In addition, there are eight additional pins in the 
    14-pin connector that can be referenced as Sensors
    009 to 016.
 </dd>
 <dt>
    Serial Occupancy Sensor Cards
 </dt><dd>
    Advanced serial occupancy sensor cards (ASCs) can be attached
    to each node.  Each one senses occupancy on up to eight track
    segments. In addition, "occupancy" and "motion" are
    separately detected.
    <p>
    Sensors on these cards are numbered in groups of 20, starting
    with 041.  With each group, the occupancy sensors are 
    start with 1, and the motion sensors start with 10.
    <p>
    Examples, all for node 22:
    <ul>
    <li>GS22041 is the occupancy sensor for the first block input on the 1st ASC.
        GS22051 is the corresponding motion sensor for the first 
        block input on the 1st ASC.
    <li>GS22061 is the occupancy sensor for the first block input on the 2nd ASC.
        GS22071 is the corresponding motion sensor for the first 
        block input on the 2nd ASC.
    <li>GS22088 is the occupancy sensor for the 8th block input on the 3rd ASC.
        GS22098 is the corresponding motion sensor for the 8th 
        block input on the 3rd ASC.
    </ul>
 </dd>
 <dt>
    Older Occupancy Sensors
 </dt><dd>
    A small number of nodes have older serial occupancy detectors
    attached.  If you have one of these, the sensors will appear
    as 021 through 036.
 </dd>
</dl>
<h3>Outputs</h3>

Each Grapevine node can have up to four output cards attached to it.
The outputs on the first card are referenced starting with 1, and
can go up to 24 depending on the type of card.
The outputs on the second card start at 25 and go up to 48.
The third and fourth cards start at 49 and 73 respectively.

<p>
Each of these can be used as a JMRI 
<a href="../../tools/Turnouts.shtml">Turnout</a>, 
<a href="../../tools/Lights.shtml">Light</a> 
or 
<a href="../../tools/Signals.shtml">Signal</a>.

<h4>Signals</h4>
To use a Grapevine output as a signal, capable of displaying
red/yellow/green and associated flashing aspects, 
you must define it as a "Grapevine Signal Head" using the
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a> button in the 
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalTable.shtml">Signal Table</a>.
Give it a system name that starts with "GH", and is followed by the node and
output numbers.  

<p>
For example, to use the 3rd connector on the 2nd driver card on node 1, 
define a Grapevine signal head using system name GH1027.  (The 2nd driver card starts with
number 025, so the 3rd connection is 25, 26, 27)
