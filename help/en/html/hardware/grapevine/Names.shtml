<h2> 
JMRI: Grapevine System Names
</h2>

Individual inputs (Sensors)  and outputs (Turnouts and Lights)
in JMRI are accessed via names.  
For information on the general scheme, please see
the 
<a href="../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">naming page</a>
in the
<a href="../../doc/Technical/index.shtml">technical documentation</a>.

<p>
For Grapevine systems, all names start with a system letter of "G".
After that, there's a 
<a href="../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml#type">type letter</a>,
then a node number and a pin number.

<p>
Each Grapevine node has a number, from 1 to 127.

<p>
The pin number, from 001 up, defines the specific input or output 
connection on the node. Note that a pin number is always three digits.

<p>
For example, the 1st Grapevine Sensor input pin on node 23 would be
named GS23001.  The 5th Turnout on node 2 would be GT2005. 

<p>
If it's helpful, you can think of the node number as being the "thousands"
part of the combined number, and the pin number as the lower three digits.

<h3>Inputs</h3>

Grapevine nodes have a number of possible inputs:
<dl>
 <dt>
    Parallel Inputs
 </dt><dd>
    There are eight three-pin connectors on a Grapevine node
    that can be used as general inputs.  These Sensors are 
    referenced as 001 to 008.
    <p>
    In addition, there are eight additional pins in the 
    14-pin connector that can be referenced as Sensors
    009 to 016.
 </dd>
 <dt>
    Serial Occupancy Sensor Cards
 </dt><dd>
    Up to three serial occupancy sensor cards can be attached
    to each node.  Each one senses occupancy on up to eight track
    segments.
