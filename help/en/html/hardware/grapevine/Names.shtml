<h2> 
JMRI: Grapevine System Names
</h2>

Individual inputs (Sensors)  and outputs (Turnouts and Lights)
in JMRI are accessed via names.  
For information on the general scheme, please see
the 
<a href="../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml">naming page</a>
in the
<a href="../../doc/Technical/index.shtml">technical documentation</a>.

<p>
For Grapevine systems, all names start with a system letter of "G".
After that, there's a 
<a href="../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml#type">type letter</a>,
then a node number and a pin number.

<p>
Each Grapevine node has a number, from 1 to 127.

<p>
The pin number, from 001 up, defines the specific input or output 
connection on the node. Note that a pin number is always three digits.

<p>
For example, the 1st Grapevine Sensor input pin on node 23 would be
named GS23001.  The 5th Turnout on node 2 would be GT2005. 

<p>
If it's helpful, you can think of the node number as being the "thousands"
part of the combined number, and the pin number as the lower three digits.

<h3>Inputs</h3>

Grapevine nodes have a number of possible inputs:
<dl>
 <dt>
    Parallel Inputs
 </dt><dd>
    There are eight three-pin connectors on a Grapevine node
    that can be used as general inputs.  These Sensors are 
    referenced as 001 to 008.
    <p>
    In addition, there are eight additional pins in the 
    14-pin connector that can be referenced as Sensors
    009 to 016.
 </dd>
 <dt>
    Serial Occupancy Sensor Cards
 </dt><dd>
    Up to three serial occupancy sensor cards can be attached
    to each node.  Each one senses occupancy on up to eight track
    segments. In addition, "occupancy" and "motion" are
    separately detected.
 </dd>
 <dt>
    Older Occupancy Sensors
 </dt><dd>
    (TBD)
 </dd>
</dl>
<h3>Outputs</h3>

Each Grapevine node can have up to four output cards attached to it.
The outputs on the first card are referenced starting with 1, and
can go up to 24 depending on the type of card.
The outputs on the second card start at 25 and go up to 48.
The third and fourth cards start at 49 and 73 respectively.

<p>
Each of these can be used as a JMRI 
<a href="../../tools/Turnouts.shtml">Turnout</a>, 
<a href="../../tools/Lights.shtml">Light</a> 
or 
<a href="../../tools/Signals.shtml">Signal</a>.

<h4>Signals</h4>
To use a Grapevine output as a signal, capable of displaying
red/yellow/green and associated flashing aspects, 
you must define it as a "Grapevine Signal Head" using the
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalAddEdit.shtml">Add...</a> button in the 
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrit/beantable/SignalTable.shtml">Signal Table</a>.
Give it a system name that starts with "GH", and is followed by the node and
output numbers.  

<p>
For example, to use the 3rd connector on the 2nd driver card on node 1, 
define a Grapevine signal head using system name GH1027.  (The 2nd driver card starts with
number 025, so the 3rd connection is 25, 26, 27)
