	    <H1>JMRI: Adding A New System</H1>

		<div class=para>
		<p>This page describes the steps to add a new data-type,
		e.g. Powerline devices, to JMRI. </P>
		
		<p>It uses as an example the addition
		of the "powerline" type in January 2008. </p>
		</div>

		<div class=list>
		<p>We list the files that are modified and created in the 
		order they were done in this case; other orders may also work,
		and you might not need to do all these.</p>
		<P>
		In this particular case, we started by copying an 
		existing system implementation (SECSI).  This effects how
		we ordered this, and made the basic process move pretty 
		quickly.
		
		<dl>

		<h3>Duplicate an existing system</h3>

		    <dt>Create a duplicate file tree</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>Using whatever tool that useful to you, 
			duplicate the src/jmri/jmrix subtree corresponding
			to the existing system you want to copy.</p>
		    </dd>

		    <dt>Clean out the CVS directories</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>It is absolutely <u>critical</u> that you remove the CVS 
			subdirectories from the duplicate directory tree you just created.
			If you don't do this, you will have difficult-to-diagnose problems
			when you try to commit this to CVS.</p>
			<p>To check that you've done that, use a command like:<br/>
			<code>find . -name CVS -print</code><br/>
		    </dd>

		    <dt>Change the package name information</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>Using your favorite editor, change all the package
			names in the new files to their new location.  In this example,
			that was a bulk replace of "jmri.jmrix.secsi" with "jmri.jmrix.powerline".
		    </dd>

		    <P>At this point, make sure you can compile. This code
		    isn't consistent yet, but it should compile.</P>

		    <dt>Check copyright dates</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>Because you've copied a system that might not
			have been touched for a while, go through and add
			the current year (and if need be, your name) to the 
			copyright notices in all the files.</p>
		    </dd>

		    <dt>Create CVS structure</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>In this step, we put the basic CVS structure in place.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Add all the directories you've created to CVS. In the example,
			this was:<br/>
			<code>cvs add powerline powerline/serialdriver powerline/serialmon<br/>
			cvs add powerline/configurexml powerline/serialdriver/configurexml</code>
			<li>Add all the COPYING files:<br/>
			<code>cvs add powerline/COPYING powerline/*/COPYING powerline/*/*/COPYING</code>
			<li>Add all the .cvsignore files:<br/>
			<code>cvs add powerline/.cvsignore powerline/*/.cvsignore powerline/*/*/.cvsignore</code>
            <li>Finally, commmit those files (but only those files):<br/>
			<code>cvs commit -m"usual file" powerline</code>            
			</ul>
		    </dd>

		    <P>At this point, make sure you can compile.</P>

		<h3>Do Basic Migration</h3>

            <dt>Migrate names</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>Using your favorite editor, change all 
            occurances of the old system name into the new one.</p>
            <code>bbedit `grep -irl secsi powerline/`</code>
            <p>Then search for and replace, perhaps not literally, all the
            occurances.</p>
            </dd>
            
		    <P>At this point, make sure you can compile.</P>

		<h3>Create Basic Tests</h3>

            <dt>Duplicate directory</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>Following the steps above, duplicate 
            the directory for the previous systems tests, creating
            a new directory in test/jmri/jmrix to contain the 
            tests.  <u>Remove the CVS subdirectories</u>, 
            change the package names, 
            check the copyright dates, 
            create the CVS structure,
            and migrate the names.</p>
            </dd>
            
		    <P>At this point, make sure you can compile
		    both the main code (which wasn't changed in this step)
		    and the tests.</P>
		    
		    <p>You should also be able to successfully run the 
		    tests in your new system (although they were created
		    for the old system's functionality):
		    <code>ant tests &amp;&amp;./runtest.csh jmri.jmrix.powerline.SerialTest</code>
            </dd>


		<h3>Connect Basics to Rest of System</h3>

            <dt>Connect to configuration menus</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>Edit the jmri/jmrix/ActiveSystemsMenu.java file (two places),
            src/jmri/jmrix/JmrixConfigPane.java (one place) and 
            src/jmri/jmrix/SystemsMenu.java (one place) files to add the new 
            system.</p>
            <p>Don't commit this to CVS yet!</p>
            </dd>

		    <P>At this point, make sure you can compile and run DecoderPro, and
		    that your new system appears in the preferences panel.</P>
            
            <dt>Connect to test tree</dt>
            <dd>
            <p>Edit the test/jmri/jmrix/JmrixTest.java file 
            to invoke your new system tests.</p>
            <p>Don't commit this to CVS yet!</p>
            </dd>

		    <P>At this point, when you "ant alltest", your new system's test
		    should be run.</P>
            

		<h3>Migrate to Basic Functionality</h3>

            <dt>Update connection options</dt>
            <dd>
            Speeds, etc, in powerline/serialdriver/SerialDriverAdapter.java.
            </dd>

            <dt>Get send/receive communications working</dt>
            <dd>
            The first step is to get communications working so that
            you can send a message from the "Send Command" window, 
            and see it and the response in the "Monitor" window.
            </dd>

		<h3>Make It Easy to Use</h3>

		    <dt>Add Possible Startup Items</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>Edit src/apps/ActionListBundle.properties to add appropriate items.</p>
		    </dd>

		<h3>Complete the documentation</h3>

		    <dt>Create The Help Tree</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>Start by duplicating, then edit, don't forget to
			update the index.</p>
			<p>You'll also have to change the locations on 
			the various frames</p>
		    </dd>

		    <dt>ant javadoc</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>Create the JavaDocs, and fix any new (or old) problems.</p>
		    </dd>

		    <dt>Add the system to the "hardware" web pages</dt>
		    <dd>
			<p>Edit help/en/html/hardware/index.shtml</p>
		    </dd>
