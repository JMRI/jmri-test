		    <H1>JMRI: Use of JavaHelp</H1>

This page talks about technical aspects of how JMRI provides help
information using JavaHelp and JHelpDev.


<h2>Organization of the help files</h2>

The help files are located in the "help" directory
within the JMRI distribution directory.
<P>
Within that, all the English-language files are located
within the "en" subdirectory.  Eventually, this will
let us internationalize the help pages.
<P>
Within that, there are several file trees:
<UL>
<LI>package - organized like the source package tree,
this contains code-specific help files for e.g. a particular
window or component.
<LI>html - general descriptions, tutorials, etc.
<LI>DecoderProManual - a version of the DecoderPro manual reformatted for 
use in the help system.
</UL>

<h2>Web access to help</h2>

It's inconvenient to have to maintain two separate web pages for the
main web site and the help system.  To reduce the need for that, we
use a particular form for the web pages in the help system.
<UL>
<LI>Use ".shtml" file extensions so that
the main web servers will search the files for
<A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/ssi.html">server-side includes</a>.
</UL>

<h2>Access in the code</h2>

Within the JMRI code, access the help system comes
via the jmri.util.HelpUtil class.
(For historical reasons, there's a little bit of code
in apps.Apps, but you should ignore that).
<P>
The easiest way to add a help menu to a 
frame is to have it be a JmriJFrame (which you 
should do anyway), and call addHelpMenu(...)
after you've built any other menus.

<P>
By convention, we use a similar file tree for 
the source code and help files.  For example,
the <code>jmri.jmrit.simpleclock.SimpleClockFrame</code>
class inherits from JmriJFrame, and adds a help menu with the line
<PRE>
<CODE>
  addHelpMenu("package.jmri.jmrit.simpleclock.SimpleClockFrame", true);
</CODE>
</PRE>
The help file is then located at 
<code>help/en/package/jmri/jmrit/simpleclock/SimpleClockFrame.shtml</code>.
<P>
A number of help files have been put in place without any contents;
hopefully some users will edit them and contribute them back.


<h2>Creating the control files with JHelpDev</h2>

JavaHelp uses various XML files to 
control how the table of contents and index are displayed.
We create those with
<A HREF="http://jhelpdev.sourceforge.net/">JHelpDev</a>.
Please don't edit them manually.

<P>
To do this:
<OL>
<LI>You have to put some files in your help/en directory 
Download 
<A HREF="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JHelpDevTool.2.zip?download">this .zip archive</a>
and put in in your project's help/en directory, then expand it.
It should create a jhelpdev.jar file, and a lib directory 
containing additional .jar files.  
These files don't show up in CVS, for various reasons.

<LI>Start the tool by clicking on the jhelpdev.jar file.

<LI>Once the window appears, select "Open Project" under the "File" menu.

<LI>Navigate to the "help" directory in your checked out copy of the code, 
then the "en" directory within that, then select the "JHelpDev.xml" file 
and click "Open".

<LI>Click the "Create All" button to recreate the maps, index, etc.
</OL>

The various control files that JavaHelp uses are stored in CVS, 
so once you've done this CVS will show them as modified.  
Please check them in when you check in new help files so other 
people don't have to recreate those control files for themselves.
<P>
You can also use the tool to add them to the table of contents, etc, if you'd like. 
There's more info on how to do that on the
<a href="http://jhelpdev.sourceforge.net/">JHelpDev web site</a>.
<P>
In the long run, we should find a way to configure JavaHelp to 
automatically find new files. 
We may not be able to make JavaHelp automatically index new files, 
that's not how JavaHelp works, 
but it should at least be able to find files from the path we provide.
