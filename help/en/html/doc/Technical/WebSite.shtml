This page discusses technical aspects of the JMRI web site.
<p>
If you just want to know how to make a small change to a web or
help page, please see the separate
<a href="webupdate/UpdatingDocs.shtml">page of instructions</a>.

<h2>Structure of Information</h2>

We distinguish between three types of information on the main web site:
<ol>
<li>User information which is useful at run time.  
This is made available both via our <A HREF="Help.shtml">JavaHelp</a>,
and also directly by placing those files on the web.
<li>User information which is either not useful at run time, such as
instructions for installing the software, or is too large for inclusion
in releases, e.g. video clinics.
<li>Reference information from releases, such as decoder definitions, copies of scripts,
JavaDocs, etc.
</ol>

We provide these separately:
<ol>
<li>Run-time user information is made available by putting the help system
on the web site.
<li>Other user information is stored in CVS as the site.new module, and
placed directly on the web site.
<li>Reference information is put on the web site from their own CVS modules,
or created by automated Ant scripts during release builds.
</ol>

<h2>Technology</h2>
Page formatting is done using CSS, originally set up by John Plocher.
All pages should reference the CSS files for screen and printing
from the "/css" directory. This also means that you should leave the
formatting to the style sheets, and minimize the explicit formatting
that you do in HTML directly.

<p>
Because we use our web pages in JavaHelp, there are some restrictions
on use of tags.  See our
<a href="Help.shtml">JavaHelp web page</a> for more on this.

<P>
We are moving toward using
<A HREF="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/ssi.html">server-side includes</a>
to provide consistent headers, sidebars and footers.
This will also allow us to share HTML
content between the web and the JavaHelp system
used by the program itself. Each page will contain just content,
plus includes for files named "Header", "Sidebar" and "Footer"
which contain the navigation information.
Eventually, all but a few index pages will have
".shtml" extensions. (The remaining index.html pages keep that name
so that people who request just a directory URL will be served something useful)

<h2>Directory Organization</h2>

The web site contains several separate areas, which translate to different 
CVS modules:
<UL>
<LI>jython, resources, xml - these are taken directly from the
CVS modules of the same name. They are only occasionally referenced
directly.
<LI>help - from the CVS module and JavaHelp system, this has the internal
structure described below and on our
<A HREF="Help.shtml">JavaHelp</a>
page.
</ul>
The rest are from the site.new CVS module, and are checked out at 
the root of the web server.
<ul>
<LI>releasenotes - Specific information on each test and production release
<LI>install - Information on how to install the JMRI software on various kinds of computers
<LI>community - Clinics, web pages, and other community-contributed information
<li>images - (Images used by web pages)
<li>contact - 
</ul>
The following directories still contain content in site.new, but are
in the process of being moved into the JavaHelp pages for use
both on the web and in the program:
<ul>
<LI>apps - 
<li>doc - 
<li>hardware - 
<LI>tools - 
</ul>
As part of the migration, a number of directories remain that contain
only redirects and/or obsolete files:
<ul>
</ul>
<H2>Local Web Site: MacOS X</H2>

If you want to host a copy of the JMRI web site on your local
MacOS X machine, follow these instructions to first configure
the Apache server to do server-side includes, and then make
a copy of the web site files available to the server.

<OL>
<LI>You need to edit the Apache web server's configuration file. 
<ul>
<li>On MacOS X 10.4 (Tiger), this is the /etc/httpd/httpd.conf file
<li>On MacOS X 10.5 (Leopard), this is the /etc/apache2/httpd.conf file
</UL>
Once you've located the file, open it with your favorite
editor (You'll need to authenticate with the administrator password to 
modify this file). 
    <ul>
    <LI>
    To turn on server-side includes, find the section that 
    looks like
<PRE>
# This may also be "None", "All", or any combination of "Indexes",
# "Includes", "FollowSymLinks", "ExecCGI", or "MultiViews".
#
# Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
# doesn't give it to you.
#
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
</PRE>
Add the word "Includes" to the last line so it looks like
<PRE>
    Options Includes Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
</PRE>
    
    <li>Now, configure the server to handle files with ".shtml" 
    extensions.  Find the section that looks like:
<PRE>
    #
    # To use server-parsed HTML files
    #
    #AddType text/html .shtml
    #AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
</PRE>
    and un-comment the last two lines so that it looks like
<PRE>
    #
    # To use server-parsed HTML files
    #
    AddType text/html .shtml
    AddHandler server-parsed .shtml
</PRE>
    </ul>

<LI>To check out a copy of the files:
    <UL>
    <LI>Change to the web server directory
<PRE>
cd /Library/WebServer/Documents
</PRE>
    <LI>Check out the relevant files
<PRE>
cvs co site.new
mv site.new/* .
mv site.new/.cvsignore .
rmdir site.new
cvs co help
cvs co jython
cvs co resources
cvs co xml
</PRE>
The "mv" commands move the files from the CVS "site.new" module
to the root level of the webservers file space, so that 
they're accessible as simple URLs.
    </UL>
<LI>Restart your computer to reinitialize the web server.
<LI>Test it by trying to display the URL
<A HREF="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a>, 
which should get you a JMRI index page.
</OL>
