<H1>JMRI: XML Schema Usage</H1>

JMRI uses XML for a number of purposes: 
to hold decoder definitions, for its
<a href="XmlPersistance.shtml">persistance system</a>
for configuration and panel information,
and to create parts of the web site from other files.
This page describes how we specify the 
content of those files using 
<a href="">XML schema</a>.

<h2>Access to Schema Definitions</h2>
JMRI uses XML Schema to define the format of its files.
<P>
Those XML Schema  need to be available to the program when it
reads the files, as they define the default values of missing
attributes and other needed information.
<P>
In the JMRI distributions, these are stored in the 
<a href="/xml/schema">xml/schema</a> 
directory.  
Note that they are not stored in each directory
alongside the XML files. There are just too many 
locations to keep such a set of schema definition files up to date.
JMRI itself, via the jmri.jmrit.XmlFile class, provides
support for locating those files when the XML parser
needs them.  
<p/>

<h2>Developing JMRI Schema</h2>

XML Schema are more verbose than the DTDs we're used to.
With that complexity, we get more expressing power, but
at the same time more ways to mess up.
<p>
It's important that the JMRI schema definitions be kept semantically
correct.  There are some subtle aspects to XML schema that it will take
us some time to get comfortable with, and if we let too many problems
build up in the meantime, we'll eventually have a lot of back-fitting to do.
The W3C online 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv">schema validation tool</a>.
is a very good tool for checking that JMRI schema changes are still technically 
correct.  You should check your changes with it before commiting them to CVS.
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to to check compliance with nested schema elements,
e.g. from DocBook (see below) or JMRIschema,
but it's still a very useful check.


<h3>The Venetian Blind Pattern</h3>

http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/ws-soa-xmlwsdl.html#N1012B

But check out this one:
http://developers.sun.com/jsenterprise/archive/nb_enterprise_pack/reference/techart/design_patterns.html
http://www.javapassion.com/webservices/XMLSchemaDesignPatterns.pdf

<p>
Our approach is based on the structure of the underlying code:
A particular *Xml class is the unit of reuse.

<p>
Overall structure of the schema; planning for inclusion, merging and reuse; 
planning for extension.

Lots of classes descend from jmri.configurexml.XmAdapter:
<a href="http://jmri.org/JavaDoc/doc/jmri/configurexml/XmlAdapter.html">see JavaDoc</a>

By convention, provide &lt;xsd:annotation&gt;&lt;xsd:appinfo&gt; element containing
the class name that reads/writes and element:
<pre><code>
    &lt;xs:annotation&gt;
        &lt;xs:documentation&gt;
        Some human readable docs go here
        &lt;/xs:documentation&gt;
        &lt;xs:appinfo&gt;
            &lt;jmri:usingclass configurexml="false"&gt;jmri.managers.DefaultSignalSystemManager&lt;/jmri:usingclass&gt;
        &lt;/xs:appinfo&gt;
    &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;
</code></pre>

Validation locally:
xmllint -schema schema/aspecttable.xsd -noout signals/AAR-1946/aspects.xml

Standard stylesheet:
<?xml-stylesheet href="schema2xhtml.xsl" type="text/xsl"?>
We really need a better one, but what can you do?

<h2>External Standards and Future Work</h2>

The 
<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/">OASIS collaboration</a>
defines a number of schema and schema elements that have become 
well-known standards. Were possible, we should use those 
<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/specs/index.php">standard elements</a>
to improve inter-operability. Perhaps the first ones of interest are:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docbook.org/">DockBook</a> defines elements for several concepts we use:
    <ul>
    <li>author (http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/author.html)
    <li>address (http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/address.html)
    <li>revision history (http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/revhistory.html)
    </ul>

http://www.docbook.org/specs/docbook-5.0-spec-cs-01.html
http://www.docbook.org/xml/5.0/xsd/
http://www.docbook.org/xml/5.0/xsd/docbook.xsd

We have our own subset that we use, because 
the full DocBook 5.0 schema takes a very long time to parse, 
and isn't fully consistent with versions of other software that we use.
We use the normal DocBook 5.0 namespace, so we can later easily convert to 
a more complete schema transparently.
Our smaller schema is located at
<a href="http://jmri.org/xml/schema/DocBook.xsd">http://jmri.org/xml/schema/DocBook.xsd</a>
(our usual schema location).

<li><a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/ubl/faq.php">UBL</a>, 
though aimed at business 
transactions, defines elements to represent parties (companies, people), 
devices, model numbers, etc.
<li><a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=office">OpenDocument</a> 
(OODF) defines a set of elements and structures for 
computations as part of its spreadsheet module. (But they provide Relax-NG schema, not W3C XML Schema,
so that doesn't help so much)
</ul>

Learning to use these will require some work, as 
we can't assume that computers using JMRI have internet access,
so can't just reference the entire schema as remote entities.

<p>
(Can we say you can't validate without an Internet connection?
Can we use weak validation to complete anyway?)
