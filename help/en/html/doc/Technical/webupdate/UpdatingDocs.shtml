<p>If you don't understand HTML here is a chance to learn a little about it.
This will not make you a high paid Web Page designer, but should give you
enough knowledge to help update JMRI documents.</p>

<p>Using MSWord or Front Page to edit these .shtml documents is not a good idea
because they will probably add in their own proprietary formatting codes that
will mess things up, possibly even to the point of being unusable by JMRI.</p>

<p>To get started, you can drill down inside your CPU's JMRI program files to
the folder for the DecoderPro manual.
On a WinXP system, the location for this folder
looks something like this -- <span
style="font-family: monospace">C:\ProgramFiles\JMRI\help\en\manual</span>.
In this folder is a file called <span
style="font-family: monospace">index.shtml</span>. Open that file with 
a text editor
and look around, being careful not to change it unless you have saved a
re-named version.</p>

<h2 id="screenshots">Creating Images from Screen Shots</h2>
<strong>For Windows</strong> 

<p>To snag a screen shot in Windows, start by setting up the window that holds
what you want to capture. Make it take up as little space on your screen as you
can while it still shows what you want. You can take a shot of the active
window (instead of your whole desktop), by pressing the <span
style="font-family: monospace">&lt;Alt&gt;</span> key and the <span
style="font-family: monospace">&lt;Print Screen&gt;</span> key at the same
time. (Note: Depending on your keyboard, you might need to press the <span
style="font-family: monospace">&lt;Fn&gt;</span> or <span
style="font-family: monospace">&lt;Function-Lock&gt;</span> key as well.) This
puts the image on your &ldquo;clipboard&rdquo; and you can paste it into an
image-editing program such as Window's Paint or Photoshop. </p>

<p><strong>For Linux</strong></p>

<p>If your distro doesn't already have a default application that supports the
use of the &lt;<span style="font-family: monospace">Print Screen</span>&gt; and
&lt;<span style="font-family: monospace">Alt + Print Screen</span>&gt; keys you
can install <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KSnapshot</a> or your favorite
application to do your screen grabbing.</p>

<p><strong>For Mac OS X</strong></p>

<p>After setting up your shot, hold down <span
style="font-family: monospace">&lt;Apple + Shift + 4&gt;</span> key. When you
release them at the same time, the cursor becomes a plus sign, and you can drag
it around the area you want. When you let go, you will have an image file on
your desktop.</p>

<p><strong>Using a Third-Party Application</strong></p>

<p>I love <a
href="http://www.irfanview.com/main_download_engl.htm">IrFanView</a> for
screenshots, and it is free. With it, you can also include your mouse cursor in
your snapshot. You can also take a series of shots easily, and even make a
slideshow of them. You can tell it what file format you want the image files to
be AND where you want them to be saved before you take the shot, and that makes
it easier to work with them in a program like Paint or Photoshop.</p>

<h2 id="sizing">Sizing and Saving the Images</h2>

<p>Any changes you make to your image should be done before you use Amaya to
insert it into your document. Remember that if you change it, it needs to be
re-inserted. Make sure you save the image as one of the following filetypes:
PNG, GIF, JPG, or JPEG (not BMP or TIF), and do not use any spaces or capital
letters in the name. Generally, a good size for the width of an image is 500
pixels or less, at a web resolution of 72 pixels per inch. If you know how to
resize your images, it would be very helpful. </p>

<h2 id="submit">Submitting to Sourceforge</h2>

<p>If you understand this, you are ready to help us update the many JMRI
documents that we use for both the JMRI website and for the Help files in the
next software build. </p>

<p>
When you submit your changes to be included in future JMRI releases, they
are given a quick check and then merged into the previous content.
The check is done by using CVS tools to find the parts of the
file that have been changed.
To make that easier, please don't reformat pages or use an 
editor that moves lines around on its own.

<p><strong>Prepare the Files</strong></p>

<p>The proper filetype to use for JMRI has the .shtml extension. If you have
made an .html or .htm file, you can change the extension yourself to .shtml
(just ignore the warning). Don't use spaces or capital letters in your
filenames. If you are not changing or adding images, just save the file with
its original name, i.e. &ldquo;index.shtml&rdquo;, 
save it where you can find it easily, and click the <a
href="#submit">Submit to Sourceforge</a> link below.</p>

<p>If you are submitting more than one file at a time (i.e. the .shtml and some
new or edited image files), then you should first copy these files into a new
folder somewhere on your hard drive, and then compress (or Zip) the folder. For
Windows XP, right click the folder, then Send To -- Compressed.</p>

<p><strong>Send to Sourceforge</strong></p>

<p>Sourceforge is a community of open-source developers and the hard-working
volunteers for the JMRI software project would welcome your help whether you
want to register with SourceForge or not. 
When you click the &ldquo;Submit to Sourceforge&rdquo;
link below, you will be taken to a page that has a link called &ldquo;Add new
Artifact.&rdquo; If you do this without being a logged-in user, you can submit
your file(s) anonymously. If you plan to do a lot of submissions, we suggest
you first use the &ldquo;Log In&rdquo; link on the top-right side, and then
&ldquo;Create an Account.&rdquo; This will allow you to keep track of what you
have submitted, and allow others to see who is contributing their time. Once
you have logged in with your new username, you can return to the proper page by
going back two times in your browser. Either way, when you click the &ldquo;Add
New Artifact&rdquo; link, you only need to provide a brief description of what
you are sending, and then upload your file or compressed folder. </p>
