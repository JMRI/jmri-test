<H1>JMRI: Patterns and Organization</H1>

JMRI has grown and evolved with time, and
you can't always see the currently-preferred
structure and patterns by looking at the older code.
<p>
This page attempts to describe the recommended structure and patterns,
and point to examples of current best practices.


<p>
At the highest level, we separate test code from 
distributed code by putting them in separate directories
within the development directory:  "test" and "src".
This makes it easy to compile a version without test code,
to apply different tools to the two types of code, etc.

<p>
Within the source code itself, we separate out several types.

<dl>
<dt>The jmri package
<dd>contains the basic interfaces for the system.
    It should contain minimal implementation code, 
    and no non-JMRI references.

<dt>The jmri.jmrix package
<dd>contains all the code for connecting to 
    specific layout hardware.

<dt>configurexml subdirectories
<dd>These contain code for the
    <a href="XmlPersistance.shtml">XML configuration system</a>. 
    top-level packages, esp util & dependencies, apps

<dt>swing subdirectories
<dd>Contain Swing specific tools.
    Particularly outside the jmri.jmrit package,
    we are trying to separate Swing code from 
    normal operational code.
    See the <a href="">Swing page</a>
    for more information.

<dt>help files
<dd>The file structure for help
    files echos the structure of the code.
    For more information, see the 
    <a href="Help.shtml">help page on JavaHelp pages</a>.

<dt>ResourceBundles
<dd>We use resource bundles for
    <a href="I8N.shtml">internationalization</a>.
    The are colocated with the code that references them,
    but we are moving to a new naming convention.
    Note that there are also a few 
    resource bundles that are used for other purposes,
    indicated in their header comments.
