<h1>JMRI: Configuration Profiles</h1>

<p><em>Configuration Profiles</em> allow a single JMRI application to be launched
    with one of multiple user-specified configurations. A configuration profile
    contains all preferences set in the JMRI preferences dialog, and may,
    optionally, include user files, a roster, and throttles.</p>

<p>When a JMRI application is launched for the first time, it checks for a
    configuration profile. If no profile exists, the application will create a
    default profile and use it without prompting you. If only a single profile
    is found, the application will use that profile without prompting you.
    If there are multiple profiles, the application will prompt you for the
    profile to use. You may specify that the application always start with the
    same profile.</p>

<h2>Profile Management</h2>

<p>Configuration profiles can be managed in the application preferences, under
    the Profile Configuration tab.</p>

<h2>Upgrading from Earlier Versions of JMRI</h2>

<p>When you first run a JMRI application after upgrading from an earlier version
    of JMRI, the application will copy its existing configuration to a new profile,
    and use that profile. If you are using a JMRI application you had not used
    prior to upgrading, the application will behave as described above.</p>
