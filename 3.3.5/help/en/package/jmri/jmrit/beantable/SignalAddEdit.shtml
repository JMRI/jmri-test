<p>
JMRI needs to know how a signal head on the layout
is connected to the electrical hardware.  Once it knows that,
it can send the right commands to control the appearance of the
signal head.
<p>
The "Add Signal Head" dialog gives you a number of different 
choices for how the signal head is connected:
<dl>
<dt>Triple Output</dt>
  <dd>
  This type controls a signal head via three electrical connections.
  One goes to a green lamp/LED, one to a yellow one, 
  and the third to a red one.
  <p>
  These connections are controlled via the JMRI Turnout
  logic, and therefore appear in the Turnout Table.
  They're not really connected to switch motors, though,
  they're just electrical outputs.
  <p>
  For each connection, enter the appropriate JMRI
  turnout for the electrical connection on the layout,
  either from the drop down list of already-defined turnouts
  or by creating a new turnout for a particular connection.
  They need not be consecutive or in any particular order.
  <p>
  If you need to debug one of these signal heads, start by
  checking whether the Turnout connections work. You can
  do this by going to the 
  <a href="TurnoutTable.shtml">Turnout Table</a> and changing the output setting
  there.
  Setting e.g.
  the turnout on the "green" connection Thrown should light the
  green lamp.
  </dd>

<dt>Double Output</dt>
  <dd>
  This type controls a signal head via two electrical connections.
  One goes to a green lamp/LED, and the other to a red one.
  Yellow is created by turning them both on at the same time.
  <p>
  These connections are controlled via the JMRI Turnout
  logic, and therefore appear in the Turnout Table.
  They're not really connected to switch motors, though,
  they're just electrical outputs.
  <p>
  For each connection, enter the appropriate JMRI
  turnout for the electrical connection on the layout,
  either from the drop down list of already-defined turnouts
  or by creating a new turnout for a particular connection.
  They need not be consecutive or in any particular order.

  Setting e.g.
  the turnout on the "green" connection Thrown should light the
  green lamp.
  </dd>
  
<dt>Quadruple Output</dt>
  <dd>
  This type controls a signal head via four electrical connections.
  One goes to a green lamp/LED, one to a yellow one, 
  one to a red one, and the fourth to a "lunar" (white) one.
  <p>
  These connections are controlled via the JMRI Turnout
  logic, and therefore appear in the Turnout Table.
  They're not really connected to switch motors, though,
  they're just electrical outputs.
  <p>

  there.
  Setting e.g.
  the turnout on the "green" connection Thrown should light the
  green lamp.
  </dd>
  
 <dt>Single Output</dt>
  <dd>
  This type controls a signal head with a single electrical connections.
  The connection can be to a single lamp/LED to display a single apperance.
  An alternative method is to connect a pair of LEDs to the single output
  wired up suitable so that when the output of the decoder is on you get one
  color and while the output is off you get the other.
  
  This type could also be used to control mechanically operated signals that only
  have two appearances and therefore always have an appearance.
  It is possible to gain a third "flashing" appearance.  
  If you have Dark and a colour selected, then the end result is an additional flash colour option
  If there are two colours selected, then you are given flash for both colours,  
  however this will result in the colours flashing alternatively.
  <p>
  These connections are controlled via the JMRI Turnout
  logic, and therefore appear in the Turnout Table.
  They're not really connected to switch motors, though,
  they're just electrical outputs.
  <p>
  For each connection, enter the appropriate JMRI
  turnout for the electrical connection on the layout,
  either from the drop down list of already-defined turnouts
  or by creating a new turnout for a particular connection.
  <p>
  If you need to debug one of these signal heads, start by
  checking whether the Turnout connections work. You can
  do this by going to the 
  <a href="TurnoutTable.shtml">Turnout Table</a> and changing the output setting
  there.
  <p>
  Appearance Closed - The appearance given when the connection is in the Closed State.
  <p>
  Appearance Thrown - The appearance given when the connection is in the Thrown State.
  </dd>
<dt>Virtual</dt>
  <dd>
  This type doesn't connect to the layout at all.
  Use it when you want to e.g. display a signal on a panel,
  but don't have a real one on the layout.
  </dd>

<dt>SE8c 4 Aspect</dt>
  <dd>
  This type controls signal heads attached to a 
  <a href="http://www.digitrax.com">Digitrax</a>
  <a href="http://www.digitrax.com/prd_statdec_se8c.php">SE8c signal driver card</a>.
  <p>
  Because each SE8c 4 Aspect signal head works with a specific DCC
  address, its system name is determined automatically from that address.  You
  don't have to enter it.  For example, the SE8c 4 Aspect signal head for 
  hardware address 257 will be given a system name based on that.
  <p>
  You can optionally enter a user name if you'd like.
  <p>
  In the "Turnout number" field, enter the appropriate DCC address 
  of the SE8c output as a number.  For example,
  the 1st signal head on the 1st SE8c, as configured from the Digitrax factory, 
  is "257" by selecting "create turnout", then selecting "LocoNet" in the drop down box,
  enter in "257" in the field next to it.
  See e.g. page 5 and 7 of the Digitrax SE8c manual 
  (<a href="http://www.digitrax.com/ftp/se8c.pdf">http://www.digitrax.com/ftp/se8c.pdf</a>).
  Do the same in the second turnout field, but entering in "258".
  <p>
  Alternately, if you're using more than one hardware type, you can 
  either select a turnout from the drop down list of already-defined turnouts
  or by creating a new turnout for a particular connection.
  They need not be consecutive or in any particular order.
  </dd>

<dt>LDT LS-DEC</dt>
  <dd>
  This type is particularly useful for European signaling.
  It controls signal heads attached to a
  <a href="http://www.ldt-infocenter.com/english/home_frame_e.htm">Littfinski DatenTechnik (LDT)</a>
  <A href="http://www.ldt-infocenter.com/english/lsdec_sb_e.htm">LS-DEC signal decoder</a>,
  or a 
  <A HREF="http://www.marathonmodel.cz/">Marathon Model</a>
  DP2N decoder.
  <p>
  These controllers use seven DCC turnout (accessory decoder) addresses to specify
  the seven possible appearances of the signal.  Enter those, 
  either from the drop down list of already-defined turnouts
  or by creating a new turnout for a particular connection.
  They need not be consecutive or in any particular order.
  <p>
  For more information on configuring these signals, see
  the 
  <a href="../../../../html/tools/signaling/ldt/output.shtml">examples page</a>.
  </dd>
  
<dt>DCC Signal Decoder</dt>
  <dd>
  This type controls signal heads attached to a 
  decoder that uses the 
  <a href="http://www.nmra.org/standards/DCC/standards_rps/rp921.html#Extended%20Accessory%20Decoder%20Control%20Packet%20Format">DCC signal packets</a>
  defined by the 
  <a href="http://www.nmra.org/standards/DCC/DCCHome.html">NMRA DCC Working Group</a> for control.
  This is a special protocol defined for driving signal heads, and is different from how
  "accessory decoders" (e.g. turnout outputs) are controlled. 
  <p>
  Enter the DCC address as a number.  The offset check box uses an alternative interpretation of the addressing scheme that might be in use.
  <p>
  Each aspect is assigned a different number; from here you can assign different numbers for each aspect to suit the hardware being used.
  </dd>

<dt>Grapevine</dt>
  <dd>
  This type controls signal heads attached to a
  <a href="http://www.protrak.cc/">ProTrak</a>
  <A href="http://www.protrak.cc/signals.htm">Grapevine node</a>.
  <p>
  In the text field, enter a system name for a Grapevine
  signal head, e.g. GH1204 for the 4th connector on the 2nd bank connector of the 1st node.
  For more information on how those names are generated, see the 
  <a href="../../../../html/hardware/grapevine/Names.shtml">page on Grapevine names</a>.
  </dd>
 <dt>MERG Signal Driver 2</dt>
  <dd>
  This type controls a signal that uses a MERG Signal Driver 2 to control its displayed aspects.
  The SD2 is driven using a steady State accessory decoder. Depending upon the number of aspects
  that are displayed on the signal, will determine the number of turnout outputs are required.
  ie.<br>
  2 Aspect requires 1 turnout<br>
  3 Aspect requires 2 turnouts<br>
  4 Aspect requires 3 turnouts
  <p>
  The Signal driver on JMRI has been setup to control the aspect output only for the SD2, 
  it does not control the other features of the SD2 such as "Steam Rules" or "Feather".
  However these can easily be configured using normal Logixs or routes.
  <p>
  <b>Notes</b> - The MERG SD2 driver does not support flashing yellow aspect, 
  for flashing yellow aspects an additional circuit is required as documented 
  in the MERG Technical Bulletins.<br>
  As the MERG SD2 driver goes beyond the Green/Yellow/Red Aspects supported in 
  JMRI with a double yellow aspect, the double yellow state is represented in the
  status as a "Lunar".
  <p>
  Further information on the Signal Driver can be found at <a href="www.merg.info">MERG</a>

The "Edit Signal Head" dialog (window) provides for viewing and changing optional 
information for existing signal heads. Use the "Edit" buttons in the 
Signal Head Table to select a signal head. Signal type and system name may not be 
changed. After making changes in the dialog, click "Update" to change signal 
head information.  Click "Cancel" to exit without
making any changes. Closing the Edit Signal Head window is equivalent to clicking 
"Cancel". Only one signal head may be edited at a time.
