        <h1>Welcome to JMRI TrainPro.</h1>
        <p><em>Note to developers: this really should be a quick start with the
                default tool bar items explained in a manner similar to the
                <a href="http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/wiki/doku.php/sdk:welcome:3_0">jMonkeyEngine SDK welcome page</a>.</em><p>
        <p><strong>This is locally cached information. Current information is

        <p>TrainPro is an application for managing and running a DCC-equipped
            model railroad.</p>
        <h2>Migrating from DecoderPro or PanelPro</h2>
        <p>TrainPro uses the same preferences files as DecoderPro and PanelPro,
            so TrainPro will, in most cases, "just work" with the other
            applications, and you should be able to switch freely back and forth
            between them. There are a few exceptions, however:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Startup buttons have been replaced with a tool bar. The tool bar
                can be customized by right-clicking on it and then clicking
                <em>Customize</em>. Changes made this way are ignored by
                DecoderPro and PanelPro; they are also not specific to a single
                configuration profile. Any startup buttons previously defined
                will be ignored.</li>
        </ul>
