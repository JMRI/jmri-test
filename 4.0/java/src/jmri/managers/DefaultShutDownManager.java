/**
 * Manage tasks to be completed when the program shuts down normally.
 * Specifically, allows other object to register and deregister
 * {@link ShutDownTask} objects, which are invoked in an orderly way when the
 * program is is commanded to terminate.
 * <p>
 * Operations:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Execute each {@link ShutDownTask} in order, allowing it to abort the
 * shutdown if needed.
 * <li>If not aborted, terminate the program.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * There can only be one instance of this operating, and it is generally
 * obtained via the instance manager.
 * <p>
 * To avoid being unable to quit the program, which annoys people, an exception
 * in a ShutDownTask is treated as permission to continue after logging.
