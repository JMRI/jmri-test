        The PacketPro JMRI application.

        <p>
            PacketPro provides a scriptable tool for sending DCC packets, 
            intended to make it easy to test DCC equipment.
        <P>
            The main routine for the PacketPro application
            is in the {@link apps.PacketPro.PacketPro} class, which 
            extensively uses support from the 
            {@link apps} package.
