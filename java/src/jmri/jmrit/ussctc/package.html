Tools for simulating a USS CTC panel.
<P>
There are a number of tools here:
<UL>
<LI>Follower - connects a Turnout to the state of a Sensor. Useful for 
e.g. driving a turnout from a switch on the fascia, or to 
drive an indicator light on a physical panel from a senor. 
A veto sensor is optionally available, e.g. to prevent a turnout from
being changed under a train.
<LI>OS Indicator - drives the lamp on the panel for a particular OS.
Honors a separate lock/unlocked indication by showing occupied if the
associated turnout has been unlocked.
</UL>

<P>
Each tool is made of three parts:
<OL>
<LI>A class that handles creation and editing of the underlying objects
that implement the tool.  For example, the
OsIndicator
class provides objects that can create the Routes and Logix needed
to implement an OS Indicator.
<LI>A class to provide a JPanel for creating and editing the objects.
For example, the OsIndicatorPanel class does this for OsIndicators.
<LI>A class to provide a default frame for embedding the panel. In
the case of Os Indicators, this is OsIndicatorFrame. These are children of 
JmriJFrames so they can inherit the features expected ot a JMRI tool frame.
<LI>A class to provide an Action that will open the frame, e.g. for use in menus.
</OL>

<p>
The underlying implementations are based on
Logix and Routes, not on specific classes.
