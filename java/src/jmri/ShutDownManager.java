/**
 * Manage tasks to be completed when the
 * program shuts down normally.
 * Specifically, allows other object to 
 * register and deregister {@link ShutDownTask} objects, 
 * which are invoked in an orderly way when the program is
 * is commanded to terminate.
 * <p>
 * Operations:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Execute each {@link ShutDownTask} in order reverse order of creation, 
 *     allowing it to abort the shutdown if needed.
 * <li>If not aborted, terminate the program.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * There can only be one instance of this operating,
 * and it is generally obtained via the instance manager.
 * <p>
 * Items are executed in reverse order to attempt to unwind the
 * creation process.  Tasks should not count on this, however, as
 * shutdown can be aborted before a particular task is reached. 
 * <p>
 * Tasks should leave the system in a state that can continue, in
 * case a later task aborts the shutdown.
 * <p>
 * An instance of this is normally obtained from the instance manager,
 * but using routines should not assume that one is always present; they
 * should check for a null manager and skip operations if needed.
