MiniServer is a small web server, the smallest scaffold 
possible for running simple servlets.

<h3>URL Mapping</h3>
The Services.properties file determines how requests (URLs) 
will be mapped to servlets. When the request is received, 
any modifiers are stripped off and then it's checked against the
defined properties. If there's a match, the value is a Servlet class
to be invoked.  If not, the last (right-most) token is removed, and
the attempt is repeated.

<h3>Servlets</h3>

Two small servlets are included:
<dl>
<dt>EchoServlet<dd>Echo the request back to the browser, so
you can see the details of the request
<dt>FileServlet<dd>Serve files back to the browser, at least
for simple cases.
</dl>
