The JMRI XML I/O package allows communications to and from a
running JMRI program through the exchange of XML-format information.

<p>
Serialization of the XML is done elsewhere, 
for example in the {@link jmri.web.servlet.xmlio} Servlet package, 
as this package works via the exchange of JDOM Element objects.

<p>
Both synchronous reads and writes, and asynchronous 
read and monitor operations are available.

<p>
The {@link jmri.web.xmlio.XmlIOFactory} class provides 
{@link jmri.web.xmlio.XmlIOServer} objects, which 
handle the interactions.  
Each XmlIOServer is independent and thread safe.

<p>
The XML schema is defined in the xmlio.xsd schema document.
A typical message is 
<code><pre>
&lt;xmlio&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;type&gt;turnout&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Turnout 12&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;set&gt;4&lt;/set&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;type&gt;turnout&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Turnout 12&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;value&gt;4&lt;/value&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;type&gt;sensor&lt;/type&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;IS34&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/xmlio&gt;
</pre></code>

<p>
The presence of a &lt;set&gt; element indicates a write;
the returned element will have the &lt;set&gt; element deleted,
but the item will remain present.

<p>
All writes are done before the values are collected for any reads,
but there is no guarantee that the consequences of the writes
have propagated completely.

<p>
A synchronous request completes immediately, having made
any changes needed and returning current values.

<p>
An asynchronous request returns immediately iff 
any object has a value different from its value element.  
Otherwise,
it returns when any values for any of the items 
changes.  All values are provided; because of the asynchronous
nature there may be more than one change recorded.

<p>
By sending an Element back and forth as an asynchronous request,
a client may reliably get <em>all</em> changing values
without risk of losing changes that occur while elements are
in transmission.  Just send an element containing references to, but
not set requests for, all interesting objects, and then keep turning it
around as an asynchronous request. The first reply will be
immediate, returning the initial values.  Later iterations will 
only return when changes have been made.

<p>
A &lt;list&gt; element returns all existing objects of a 
given type as a list of &lt;item&gt; elements. 
This can then be turned
around to start a sequence of read and monitor operations.

<code><pre>
&lt;xmlio&gt;
    &lt;list&gt;
        &lt;type&gt;turnout&lt;/type&gt;
    &lt;/list&gt;
&lt;/xmlio&gt;

</pre></code>

<p>
A &lt;throttle&gt; element
can be used to control a DCC Throttle via the
default ThrottleManager.  The first use 
allocates the throttle, and all later ones
set any attributes present:

<code><pre>
&lt;xmlio&gt;
    &lt;throttle&gt;
        &lt;address&gt;1234&lt;/address&gt;
        &lt;speed&gt;0.75&lt;/speed&gt;
        &lt;forward&gt;true&lt;/forward&gt;
        &lt;F3&gt;false&lt;/F3&gt;
    &lt;/throttle&gt;
&lt;/xmlio&gt;

</pre></code>

A throttle element is returned unchanged.
