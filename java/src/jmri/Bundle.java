/**
 * Provides standard access for resource bundles in a package.
 * 
 * Convention pattern is to provide a subclass of the same name
 * in each package, working off the local resource bundle name.
 * <p>
 * This is the root of a tree of classes that are chained 
 * through class-static members so that they each do a search
 * as a request works up the inheritance tree.
 *<p>
 * Only a single package-scope method is exposed from the class, 
 * forcing all requests for strings to be a the package level.
