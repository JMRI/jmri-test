This is the README file for the jmrix.Apps package.

The jmrix Java package defines implementations for the JMRI interfaces. 

The jmrix.Apps package contains directories for various applications.  This
structuring is intended to reduce dependencies between and within the jmri.*
and jmrix.* components.

Defined applications:

	JMRIdemo:  	 Full featured demo, aim is to include _everything_
	
	LocoMonAppl: A standalone LocoNet monitor program 
				 that's meant to be as simple as possible (currently broken)
