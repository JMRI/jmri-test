This is the README file for the jmrix.Apps.LocoMonAppl package.

The jmrix Java package defines implementations for the JMRI interfaces. 

The jmrix.Apps package contains directories for various applications.  This
structuring is intended to reduce dependencies between and within the jmri.*
and jmrix.* components.


This package was the first JMRI demo application.  To a large extent, it has been
superceded by the JMRIdemo.java application.    Its not even clear that it now
(July 1, 2001) still as the packages still evolves.

Does anybody want to revive this as a light-weight demo?
