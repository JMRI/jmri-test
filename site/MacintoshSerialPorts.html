The same adaptermay also work with other protocols, particularly those that use"hardware flow control".<P>The information on this page was provided by Dick Bronson and Walter Thompson.<P><img src="images/LB-II-Mac.gif" ALT="wiring diagram" WIDTH="374" HEIGHT="192" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="0"/><P>Note that the Macintosh has only one status output and input.<P>If the serial device uses "hardware flow control", it will assert the CTSlead to indicate when it's OK to send data.  That has to be connected tothe Macintosh input lead, or the program won't be able to send.<P>The status output will be set active by JMRI at startup. It should be connectedto whatever status leads (e.g. RTS) the serial device looks at.<HR><BR>Site hosted by: <BR><A href="http://sourceforge.net"> <IMG src="http://sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?group_id=26788&amp;type=1" width="88" height="31" border="0" alt="SourceForge Logo"> </A> <hr>Bob Jacobsen<BR>jake@physics.berkeley.edu</body></html></body></html>
