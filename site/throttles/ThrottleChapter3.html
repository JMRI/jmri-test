							<P>When a new throttle window is initialized, all function button labels
							are set up with a set of defaults (F1...F2...F3...etc.).  These are
							closely related to hand-held throttles.  But one of the cool features
							that the JMRI Throttles have to offer over hand-held throttles, is the
							ability to customize the button labels.  In addition, each button can
							be hidden from view or switched to an "unlocked" button.</P>
							
							<P>The example image on the right shows the default Function Panel window.
							When the mouse pointer hovers over the top of the button, a
							<STRONG>right click</STRONG> of the mouse will display a menu —

				<P>By default, the <STRONG>Function Number</STRONG> is associated with the button number that you initially right-clicked on.
				For example, in the figures shown above, function number "1" (F1) is being edited.  It is recommended that you leave this
				number as is, however, you <U>can</U> change this to a different function number if you really wish.  
				An example of why you might want to do this is if you really
				want the "lights" button — which is usually F0 (located as the last/bottom button by default) — to be located as
				the first button in the Function Panel.</P>

							<DIV>
								<FONT COLOR="red">Warning!</FONT> &nbsp; If any modifications are done to the "Function Number" field,
								verify to make sure that no two buttons are assigned the same function number — some unwanted
								consequences may occur.
							</DIV>
						</TD>
					</TR>
				</TABLE>

				<P>The <STRONG>Text</STRONG> field will be the most welcome and modified field.  By default, it is set similar to hand-held
				throttles:  F1...F2...F3...etc.  The content of the field is pretty much open to the imagination, however, there is going to
				be a point where the length of the text is <U>not</U> going to fit on the button.  The <STRONG>Font Size</STRONG> field is
				available to also assist in getting the wanted text to fit on the button.  A little experimentation will be required here
				to determine what looks good for you — and what will fit.</P>
				
				<P>The <STRONG>Lockable</STRONG> checkbox may be a little confusing at first.  When enabled — as it is by default —
				it simply means that when the button is clicked on, it will "lock" itself in either an "on" state
				or an "off" state.  In other words, the button will act as a toggle switch — click once to turn the function "on";
				click again to turn the function "off".  The opposite of this action is what happens when the checkbox is <B>disabled</B>.
				Then the button acts like a momentary switch — supplying a momentary "on" command for as long as the mouse button is
				clicked <I>and held</I> over the button.  When the mouse button is released, an "off" command is sent to the function.
				A good example of where one might want to use this is when customizing a throttle setup for a sound decoder.  The horn/whistle
				is closer to functional when this option is disabled.  Depending on the speed of the computer system and the DCC system,
				short and quick click and releases would provide a short blast of the horn or whistle.  Holding down the button a little
				longer would produce a longer held blast of the whistle.</P>
				
				<P>The <STRONG>Visible</STRONG> checkbox allows for the "removal" of unwanted buttons.  By default, all function buttons are
				enabled as "visible" so that they can obviously be seen.  But if there is only a single function being used — for example
				the "lights" (F0) — then this option does provide the ability to "hide" all of the other buttons.</P>

				<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=4 CELLSPACING=2 BORDERCOLOR="red">
					<TR>
						<TD>
							<DIV>
								<FONT COLOR="red">Warning!</FONT> &nbsp; Disabling the "Visible" checkbox should be one of the last steps
								performed during this customization process.  The reason for this is that once the button is marked as
								"invisible" (by removing the checkbox), it is indeed invisible to the user and therefore can't be right-clicked
								on with the mouse in order to get this "Edit" window back.  It is a bit more difficult to restore a hidden
								button afterwards.  This is going to be changed at some point in the future with a menu option that will allow
								a hidden button to be restored.  Until then, use caution that when you remove the checkbox — you
								really mean it.

								<P>Clicking on the "<BIG>View</BIG>" menu option displays a small menu of
								3 items — by default, each with a check mark preceding the item.  This
								corresponds to the 3 sub-windows (Address Panel, Function Panel, & Control
								Panel) that make up the overall throttle window.</P>
								
								<P>As noted in <A HREF="ThrottleChapter1.html">Chapter 1</A>, because each
								sub-window has a minimize and close buttons, if one gets closed down in
								error, this menu option allows you to restore the window again.</P>
								
								<P>Another way to use this option is when using the features of the throttles
								for decoders that are <U>not</U> associated with a motor (such as a lighted
								passenger car or caboose or a Fred unit).  In these cases, critical screen
								real estate can be saved by being able to disable (or close down) the
								Control Panel.  Be a little creative with the window resizing, and you
								could have several of these custom throttle windows in the same area as one
								single complete throttle window would take up.</P>
