<H2>JMRI logging of status and error information</h2>

This page provides a little information on how 
JMRI logs error, status and debugging information.

<P>
For other details on JMRI internals, please see the
<A HREF="../Technical/index.html" NAME="technical pages">technical pages</A>.

<P>
JMRI uses the Jakarta
<A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html">Log4J</a>
package to handle logging during program operation.
<P>
Log4J provides several levels of messages:
<UL>
<LI>Error - Something that really should never happen, and 
that indicates a severe problem in the code itself
<LI>Warning - An unexpected situation, that might be due to 
an unexpected condition, etc.  Warnings are useful for 
giving the user hints about possible causes if the program 
misbehaves later.
<LI>Info - Summary information during normal operation, typically
indicating normal conditions.
<LI>Debug - information on the internal operation of the program.  
There is a lot of this, and turning it all on can slow the 
program down significantly.
</UL>

<h3>Controlling logging</h3>
By convention, JMRI applications will attempt to initialize
Log4J using a "default.lcf" file.  The JMRI distributions
contain a version of this file with
extensive comments.

<P>
The line:
<PRE>
 log4j.rootCategory=DEBUG, A1
</PRE>
controlls the basic function. As written above, this
lists all messages of "DEBUG" level and above to 
the "A!" output.  Later in the file, "A1" is defined as
output to the console (command line).

<P>
If you change the line:

<PRE>
 log4j.rootCategory=DEBUG, A1
</PRE>
to 
<PRE>
 log4j.rootCategory=DEBUG, A1, R
</PRE>
log entries will be written to both the "console"
by "A1", and a file by "R". "R" is defined later in the
file; you can change the name of the output file, etc there.

<P>
You can also control the level of logged output for an individual
class using a line like:
<PRE>
  log4j.category.jmri.jmrix.nce=DEBUG
</PRE>
The above line will log all "debug" and above messages 
(e.g. all messages) from classes in the jmri.jmrix.nce package and all
subpackages, regardless of the previously-set global logging level.  
This provides a clean method of getting detailed logging
output from just the classes being debugged.
There are examples of this (in most cases commented out with # signs)
near the bottom of the file.

<h3>Adding logging to your code</h3>

To add logging to a class, first put a line like this inside your class
(by convention, we do this near the bottom of the file):
<pre>
    static org.apache.log4j.Category log = org.apache.log4j.Category.getInstance(MyClass.class.getName());
</pre>
Note the "MyClass"l that needs to be changed to the name of the class you're adding this
too.  This line defines an object called "log", which can then be used for logging like
this:
<pre>
  log.debug("Some useful message!");
</pre>

<h3>Logging perforamnce</h3>
Is there a performance impact for messages that don't get logged? 
Specifically, does it cost performance to have lots of debugging messages
in the program that are not being printed?  Should you remove them?
<P>
In general, the cost of a statement like this:
<pre>
  log.debug("Some useful message!");
</pre>
is very small; probably at the level of microseconds.  Unless it's in a 
very tight loop, the performance impact is probably negligable.
<P>
But statements like this can be costly:
<pre>
  log.debug(someSlowRoutine());
</pre>
because someSlowRoutine() needs to run to create the logging message
before log.debug() is called, so gets run regardless of whether logging
is happening or not.
<P>
To improve this, recode expensive error messages as
<pre>
  if (log.isDebugEnabled()) log.debug(someSlowRoutine());
</pre>

In general it's not wise to remove debugging statements; the odds are 
that somebody will need them eventually.
