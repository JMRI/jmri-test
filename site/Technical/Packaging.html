<H2>JMRI Packaging</H2>

This page discusses how JMRI is packaged for various systems.
<P>
The JMRI collection of classes are normally distributed in a "jmri.jar" file, 
which contains only the JMRI classes.  These require other publicly-available
Java classes, which are normally distributed separately as jar files.  
The exact set of jar files varies from platform to platform.
In some cases, e.g. DecoderPro, we package an additional set of 
startup scripts with the jmri.jar file to start from a different main class.

<h3>Macintosh</h3>

<h4>MacOS "Classic", 8.1 through 9.X</h4>

The main jmri.jar file contains all of our code.  The "JmriDemo" application
configures Java, and then starts the JMRI code.
<P>
External jar files are included in the 
lib folder in the distribution. These are expected to be somewhat stable
so we've put them in a separate place to make updaters easy to create.
Note that we don't have any updaters yet.
<P>
You need to have the Java Swing and Java communications libraries installed.
We no longer distribute them with the program, as they are quite 
large and don't change often.
An installer can be downloaded from
  <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JavaLibsInstaller-2.hqx">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JavaLibsInstaller-2.hqx</a>.
Unfortunately, its a 4MB download.  You only have to do it once, however; 
future updates will continue to use these same libraries.
<P>

<h4>MacOS X</h4>

The main jmri.jar file contains all of our code.  The "JmriDemoX" application
configures Java, and then starts the JMRI code.
<P>
External jar files are included in the 
lib folder in the distribution. These are expected to be somewhat stable
so we've put them in a separate place to make updaters easy to create.
Note that we don't have any updaters yet.
<P>
The communications API needs to be installed into MacOS X
system directories. An installer to do that can be downloaded from
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JavaCommInstaller04.hqx">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JavaCommInstaller04.hqx</a>.
You will need the MacOS X administrator password to run it.

<h3>OS/2</h3>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<h3>Windows</h3>

Starting with the 0.9b6 distributions, we are including .bat files
that let the programs run from the same .jar files on Windows as
on all other platforms.  (Previously, we had to distribute a single
merged .jar file specific to windows).
