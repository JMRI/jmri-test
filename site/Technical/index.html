This is the "technical" page of the JMRI website.  Right now, it's just a 
pile of various information.  Eventually we have to organize it!

<P>
See also the 
<A HREF="loconet/LocoNetClasses.html">documentation for the LocoNet-specific classes</a>.

<h3>JMRI project information (For people interested in how the software is being written)</h3>
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmri/">Project page</A><P>
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/export/projhtml.php?group_id=26788">Statistics and links</A><P>
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/export/projnews.php?group_id=26788">News items</A><P>

You can download the most recent source code using:
<PRE>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.jmri.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/jmri co ant 
</PRE>
<P>

<H3>Source snapshots</H3>
Occasional snapshots of the CVS source
<A HREF="snapshots">are available</A>
for download as .zip files.   Note that these don't contain the .jar files, 
documentation tree, etc; they're just source files.

<h3>JavaDoc</h3>
We'll occasionally upload a set of JavaDoc pages
to the 
<A HREF="doc/">doc directory</A>.
Please expect these to be somewhat out of date with respect to the
actual code! 
<P>Starting points:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="doc/index.html">Packages</A>
<LI><A HREF="doc/allclasses-frame.html">Class heirarchy</A>
<LI><A HREF="doc/index-all.html">Name index</A>
</UL>

<H3>Intro to demo program structure</h3>

The demo program is just an example, but it's meant to be a good one.
<P>
The source for the main class currently lives in apps/JmriDemo/JMRIdemo.java,
which defines the main class as apps.JmriDemo.JMRIdemo.  
<P>
The demo main just creates the menubar, and populates if with the desired menus
and items. Each item as a "Action" class object associated with it, which does the
necessary initialization when needed.
<P>
Because we expect to have different interfaces in the jmrix package, the JMRI tools
don't directly create the interface objects they need.  Rather, they ask for instances
of interfaces. For interfaces in the jmri package, which might be implemented by
lots of different layout types, jmri.InstanceManager satisfies these requests.

</UL>
<h3>Development tools</h3>

<A id="JBuilder">
Development is currently done using Borland's JBuilder.  The Personal Edition
is available for free download at 
<A HREF="http://www.borland.com/jbuilder/personal/">http://www.borland.com/jbuilder/personal/</A>.
Once you have it installed, the steps to get a working project are:
<UL>
<LI>Create a "project" directory.
<LI>In the project directory, do a CVS checkout of the "jbuilder" 
module from our repository. This will create a "java" subdirectory 
where the JBuilder IDE will run, and load it with source, tests and resources.
It will also create and populate directories for xml and libraries in the 
project directory.
<LI>Change to the newly created java subdirectory. Start JBuilder with the 
jmri.jpx file you'll find there.
<LI>Click run, and sit back to watch it go.
</UL>

<P>
<A id="ant">
Those of you who prefer a command line approach might want to investigate "ant", a
better make-like utility for Java projects.  Ant is available for 
download at
<A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html/</a>. 
Install it, then:
<UL>
<LI>Create a "project" directory.
<LI>In the project directory, do a CVS checkout of the "ant" 
module from our repository. This will create a "java" subdirectory 
where Ant will run, and load it with source, tests and resources.
It will also create and populate directories for xml and libraries in the 
project directory.
<LI>Change to the newly created java subdirectory. To compile, type "ant compile"; 
to create a .jar file, type "ant dist". Note that you don't have to create the
.jar file to run the program.
<LI>To run the program, type "ant decoderpro" or "ant jmridemo", and sit back to watch it go.
<LI>To run the test suite, type "ant alltest".
<LI>To build a jmri.jar file, type "ant dist".
</ul>

<P>
Originally, I (Bob) used CodeWarrior on the Macintosh as a development platform. This handles
selective recompilation, etc, and provides nice IDE capabilities.  The debugger
part is just about unusable, however.  I'd be happy to send you a copy of the 
project files if you'd like to use CW.

<h3>Recommended Tools</h3>
<UL>
<LI>
We use CVS for code control. Linux and MacOS X systems come with an installed
version that will work well.
<P>
If you're using MacOS X, CVS may give you messages about ".DS_Store" files. These
are used to keep track of window layouts, etc.  To suppress these messages,
just create a file in your home directory called ".cvsignore" and add a line 
of ".DS_Store" to it (no quotes). CVS will then ignore all .DS_Store files in 
all of your checked-out directory trees.

<LI>
We use Java Swing for our GUI development.  It's a lot more powerful
than the original AWT, and the price is right. In particular, we
try to use the "Bean format" of setting and getting members, call-backs to
notify of changes, etc, to make it easier to build applications from JRMI components.

<LI>The Java communications toolbox (javax.comm) has worked fine on 
Macintosh, OS/2 and Linux for serial I/O. We hope it works fine on other platforms. 
For Windows, we had to move to 
the Serialio package from
<A HREF="Serialio.com">Serialio.com</a>
to be able to use the MS100 baud rate.  To do this, the 
jmri.jmrix.loconet.ms100.MS100Adapter class was converted to use
Java reflection to decide which whether the Serialio package is
available; on other systems, it uses javax.comm.
Note that our license for Serialio limits it to this use only;
we are not permitted to distribute the libraries for other purposes.

<LI>Originally, we used ErrLoggerJ for logging of messages, etc.  We're now
switching to log4j as it's both easier and more powerful.  To log messages
from a class named MyClass, add this to the bottom of the class file:
<code>
<PRE>
	static org.apache.log4j.Category log 
	        = org.apache.log4j.Category.getInstance(MyClass.class.getName());
</PRE>
</code>
Then for each message to log insert a line like:
<code>
<PRE>
	if (log.isInfoEnabled()) log.info("message");
</PRE>
</code>
Message types are "fatal", "error", "warn", "info" and "debug".
<LI>The 
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/">Java recommendations</A>
for names, formatting, etc are really useful.
If you find that you can't read a piece of code, these will help
make it better.
<LI>The Java collections (List, etc) are available in JMRI, because
we need them for various other packages.  Use them if you'd like; there 
are often better approaches than to make everything a Vector.
To ensure compatibility with Java 1.1.8, we use the 
older form of class names, e.g. "com.sun.java.util.collections.List".
<LI>It's really helpful to have tests for code, especially code that's
being built by several people.  We use JUnit for that; see the section
below.
</UL>

<h3>Threading model</h3>
The initial threading model for JMRI is quite simple: Everything happens in 
the GUI thread.  For example, once a 'message', e.g. a LocoNet packet, 
is accumulated in a separate thread, the message is processed in the 
GUI thread via:
<PRE>
	// message is complete, dispatch it !!
	{ 
	final LocoNetMessage thisMsg = msg;
	final LnTrafficController thisTC = this;
	// return a notification via the queue to ensure end
	Runnable r = new Runnable() {
		LocoNetMessage msgForLater = thisMsg;
		LnTrafficController myTC = thisTC;
		public void run() { 
				log.debug("Delayed notify starts");
           		myTC.notify(msgForLater);
			}
		};
		javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater(r);
	}
</PRE>

<h3>Jar files</h3>
The various .jar files used in building the demos are available from the
<A HREF="JARfiles">JARfiles subdirectory</A>
and the "lib" package in CVS.

<h3>JUnit</H3>
Some of the classes have JUnit tests available.  For more information on JUnit, see
<A HREF="http://www.junit.org">the JUnit home page</A>.
A very interesting example of test-based development is available from 
<A HREF="http://www.objectmentor.com/publications/xpepisode.htm">Robert Martin</a>'s new book.

<h3>Other efforts similar to JMRI</h3>
The 
<A HREF="http://www.der-moba.de/Digital/">DER_MOBA digital project</a>
is working on a client-server system interface.  Much of their discussions
takes place on the 
<A HREF="news:de.rec.modelle.bahn">de.rec.modelle.bahn</a> news group.

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.kamind.com">KAM Industries</A>
has created a layout-level communications interface. They've proposed it to the NMRA
for standardization.  A 1998 NMRA Convention 
<A HREF="http://www.kamind.com/Clinics/NMRA-98/NMRA-98_Train_Tools_API_files/frame.htm">clinic writeup</A> 
is available.  On their web pages, they refer to this as 
<A HREF="http://www.kamind.com/Products/ds_TrainSrv_060000.asp">"Train server"</A>. It appears
to be based on Windows-specific technologies. 

<P>
The 
<A HREF="http://members.home.net/rrsim/">RRsim group</a> 
wants to create more realistic simulations of railroad operations.  
They operate a mailing list. They've also
proposed a cab bus standard to the NMRA.

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bay/4803/">Rail Command System</A>
is a mixed hardware/software layout automation project by F. Peterson. He's recently
moved to a client/server Java model.
