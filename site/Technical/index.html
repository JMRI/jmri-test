This is the "technical" page of the JMRI website.  Right now, its just a 
pile of various information.  Eventually we have to organize it!

<P>
See also the 
<A HREF="LocoNetClasses.html">documentation for the LocoNet-specific classes</a>.

<H3>Source snapshots</H3>
Occasional snapshots of the CVS source
<A HREF="snapshots">are available</A>
for download as .zip files.   Note that these don't contain the .jar files, 
documentation tree, etc; they're just source files.

<h3>JavaDoc</h3>
We'll occasionally upload a set of JavaDoc pages
to the 
<A HREF="Docs/">Docs directory</A>.
Please expect these to be somewhat out of date with respect to the
actual code! 
<P>Starting points:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="Docs/AllNames.html">Name index</A>
<LI><A HREF="Docs/packages.html">Packages</A>
<LI><A HREF="Docs/tree.html">Class heirarchy</A>
</UL>

<H3>Intro to demo program structure</h3>

The demo program is just an example, but its meant to be a good one.
<P>
The source for the main class currently lives in jmrix/loconet/Apps/JMRIdemo.java,
but note that it does not define the class as living in any Java package.  The
demo was developed originally for the LocoNet aspects, but will eventually be more general.
<P>
The demo main just creates the menubar, and populates if with the desired menus
and items. Each item as a "Action" class object associated with it, which does the
necessary initialization when needed.
<P>
Because we expect to have different interfaces in the jmrix package, the JMRI tools
don't directly create the interface objects they need.  Rather, they ask for instances
of interfaces. For interfaces in the jmri package, which might be implemented by
lots of different layout types, jmri.InstanceManager satisfies these requests.
<P>
Examples:
<UL>
<LI>A SimpleProgFrame (simple programmer) is created by a SimpleProgAction when
fired. 
SimpleProgAction and SimpleProgFrame don't know that LocoNet is in use, so they can't
create the correct instance of Programmer; instead they defer any reference
to Programmer until a button is pushed, and its necessary to do something.
When that Frame is eventually asked to do something, it will
use the jmri.InstanceManager.programmerInstance() method to find an implementation
of the Programmer interface. If its not been created, an error is posted.

<LI>A LocoMon (LocoNet monitor) frame is created by the LocoMonAction. Since its
clear that this will be communicating with Loconet, it also
connects that Frame to the LnTrafficController which it finds with the static
instance() method of LnTrafficController.  instance will create a LnTrafficController
if one doesn't exist.  Note that this process configures the LocoMon to recieve any
relevant traffic, but doesn't make the connections to the layout; that's 
done in the next example.

<LI>The MS100 LocoNet interface is configured by the MS100Action class in jmrix.loconet.ms100.
When fired, this action configures the LocoNet-specific classes so that they
are ready to communicate.
(See the page on <A HREF="LocoNetClasses.html">LocoNet-specific classes</a>
for specifics). This includes ensuring a LnTrafficManager exists, and connecting
it to a comm port and MS100 via a LnPortController implementation.
If no Programmer instance is registered with the jmri.InstanceManager, 
a loconet.SlotManager is created to do that.

</UL>
<h3>Development tools</h3>
I (Bob) use Code Warrior on the Macintosh as a development platform. This handles
selective recompilation, etc, and provides nice IDE capabilities.  The deugger
part is just about unusable, however.  I'd be happy to send you a copy of the 
project files if you'd like to use CW.

<P>
Eventually, we'll probably have to move to a platform-independent system 
like Ant.  That would then work on any machine that people are interested in.

<h3>Recommended Tools</h3>
<UL>
<LI>We use Java Swing for our GUI development.  Its a lot more powerful
than the original AWT, and the price is right. In particular, we
try to use the "Bean format" of setting and getting members, call-backs to
notify of changes, etc, to make it easier to build applications from JRMI components.

<LI>The Java communications toolbox (javax.comm) has worked fine on 
Macintosh, OS/2 and Linux for serial I/O. We hope it works fine on other platforms. 
If more complicated I/O is needed, then perhaps a JNI interface can be 
constructed, but we'd certainly like to avoid that!
<LI>Originally, we used ErrLoggerJ for logging of messages, etc.  We're now
switching to log4j as its both easier and more powerful.  To log messages
from a class named MyClass, add this to the bottom of the class file:
<code>
<PRE>
	static org.apache.log4j.Category log 
	        = org.apache.log4j.Category.getInstance(MyClass.class.getName());
</PRE>
</code>
Then for each message to log insert a line like:
<code>
<PRE>
	if (log.isInfoEnabled()) log.info("message");
</PRE>
</code>
Message types are "fatal", "error", "warn", "info" and "debug".
<LI>The 
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/">Java recommendations</A>
for names, formatting, etc are really useful.
If you find that you can't read a piece of code, these will help
make it better.
<LI>The Java collections (List, etc) are available in JMRI, because
we need them for various other packages.  Use them if you'd like; there 
are often better approaches than to make everything a Vector.
<LI>Its really helpful to have tests for code, especially code that's
being built by several people.  We use JUnit for that; see the section
below.
</UL>

<h3>Threading model</h3>
The initial threading model for JMRI is quite simple: Everything happens in 
the GUI thread.  For example, once a 'message', e.g. a LocoNet packet, 
is accumulated in a separate thread, the message is processed in the 
GUI thread via:
<PRE>
	// message is complete, dispatch it !!
	{ 
	final LocoNetMessage thisMsg = msg;
	final LnTrafficController thisTC = this;
	// return a notification via the queue to ensure end
	Runnable r = new Runnable() {
		LocoNetMessage msgForLater = thisMsg;
		LnTrafficController myTC = thisTC;
		public void run() { 
				log.debug("Delayed notify starts");
           		myTC.notify(msgForLater);
			}
		};
		javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater(r);
	}
</PRE>

<h3>Jar files</h3>
The various .jar files used in building the demos are available from the
<A HREF="JARfiles">JARfiles subdirectory</A>. Note that up to the 0.5 demo,
only swingall.jar and a version of the javax.comm.*.jar was needed (javax.comm.MRJ.jar
is the Mac OS Classic version). For development after 0.5, you should assume
all the .jar files in this area are needed.  junit.jar is for testing, and doesn't
need to be distributed with product releases.

<h3>JUnit</H3>
Some of the classes have JUnit tests available.  For more information on JUnit, see
<A HREF="http://www.junit.org">the JUnit home page</A>.
A very interesting example of test-based development is available from 
<A HREF="http://www.objectmentor.com/publications/xpepisode.htm">Robert Martin</a>'s new book.

<h3>Other efforts similar to JMRI</h3>
The 
<A HREF="http://www.der-moba.de/Digital/">DER_MOBA digital project</a>
is working on a client-server system interface.  Much of their discussions
takes place on the 
<A HREF="news:de.rec.modelle.bahn">de.rec.modelle.bahn</a> news group.

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.kamind.com">KAM Industries</A>
has created a layout-level communications interface. They've proposed it to the NMRA
for standardization.  A 1998 NMRA Convention 
<A HREF="http://www.kamind.com/Clinics/NMRA-98/NMRA-98_Train_Tools_API_files/frame.htm">clinic writeup</A> 
is available.  On their web pages, they refer to this as 
<A HREF="http://www.kamind.com/Products/ds_TrainSrv_060000.asp">"Train server"</A>. It appears
to be based on Windows-specific technologies. 

<P>
The 
<A HREF="http://members.home.net/rrsim/">RRsim group</a> 
wants to create more realistic simulations of railroad operations.  
They operate a mailing list. They've also
proposed a cab bus standard to the NMRA.

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bay/4803/">Rail Command System</A>
is a mixed hardware/software layout automation project by F. Peterson. He's recently
moved to a client/server Java model.
