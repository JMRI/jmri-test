<h1>Jython access to JMRI tools</h1>

This is a "technical" page of the JMRI website.  Eventually we have to organize it better!
<P>
This page discusses access to the JMRI libraries from Jython, a Java version
of Python.  This capability is being actively developed, and this 
page will not always be up-to-date.
<P>
See also the 
<A HREF="index.html">base page for technical documentation</a>.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<A HREF="http://www.python.org">Python<a/> is a widely used scripting language that's
available on many types of computers.  A Java-based varient, called
<A HREF="http://www.python.org">Jython</a>,
has been integrated with JMRI to make it easy to control a model railroad
from the command line of a computer.

For example:

<PRE>

<H2>Setup</H2>

Jython support is not (yet) standard in JMRI.  To use this:
<OL>
<LI>You must first have a working JMRI installation.  In particular, 
start the JmriDemo application and configure it to connect to your DCC
hardware, then save, quit and restart the program.  Make sure that the
connection is working for the menu-based tools before trying to use Jython.
<LI>Download and install Jython from
<A HREF="http://www.jython.org">http://www.jython.org</a>.  
Development is using the 2.1 version, so you
might want to start with that.  On MacOS X, the installer does not run, so you
have to manually invoke the jython_21.class file; the the MacOS X note
on the jython web site.  Make sure the installation is complete
by invoking jython from the command line:
<PRE>
   % jython
   Jython 2.1 on java1.4.1_01 (JIT: null)
   Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>> ^D
</PRE>
<LI>
Now you just have to have the required classes in the CLASSPATH
used when jython starts up.  The required list in Unix syntax is:
<PRE>
  setenv CLASSPATH .:jmri.jar:lib/log4j.jar:lib/collections.jar:lib/crimson.jar:lib/jdom-jdk11.jar
</PRE>
<BR/>
To save typing, the "jmrithon" script is available for use on Linux
and MacOS X systems:
<PRE>
  % ./jmrithon
  Jython 2.1 on java1.4.1_01 (JIT: null)
  Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> ^D
</PRE>
<BR/>The first time you run this, you'll get a number of messages
about "processing modified jar"; these can be ignored, as they are normal.
</OL>

<H2>Using Python for signal logic and automation</h2>

The existing JMRI 
"<A HREF="../Automat.html">Automat</a>"
classes provide hooks for user layout automation, including signalling.
But they require that you write Java code and compile it into .class files.
<P>
The 
<A HREF="doc/jmri/jmrit/automat/JythonAutomaton.html">JythonAutomaton</a>
class is intended to make it easier to code custom layout automation, as
it will allow you to invoke a Jython script.  Once it's integrated into
the configuration process, you'll be able to code your automation in one
or more .py files, and have the program start running them at startup.
