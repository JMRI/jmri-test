This page discusses how the JMRI libraries handle internationalization.
For more information on JMRI, see the
<A HREF="../index.html">main JMRI page</a>.

<P>
The JMRI libraries are intended to be usable world-wide.
To make this possible, they make use of the "internationalization"
features built into the Java language and libraries.

<h2>Use of Locales</h2>

JMRI uses the default Locale for locating internationalization
information.  That means that JMRI will present its user interface
in the language Java has defined as the default for that computer.

<P>
Locals are specified by a language, and optionally a country. The
language is a two letter lower-case code; the country is a two letter
upper case code.  "en" is English, "fr" is French, "de" is German, 
and "de_CH" is German as spoken in Switzerland.

<h2>Use of Resource Bundles</h2>
The text for menus, buttons and similiar controls is contained in
property files, which are accessed via the Resource Bundle mechanism
of java.util.

<H2>Adapting to a new language</h2>
It takes some work to adapt JMRI to a new language.  The steps include:
<UL>
<LI>Create new versions of the .properties files to change the language
of the GUI controls.
<LI>Create new decoder XML files in the new language.
<LI>Optionally, create new versions of GIF images used for logos
and icons.
<LI>Create a copy of the website and manuals.
</UL>

<h2>English-only resources</h2>
Some parts of JMRI remain English only due to our developer population.
In particular, comments and variable names in the code should remain in
English, as should messages sent to the logging system.  
<P>
As JMRI is open source, it would be OK to take a copy of the source
and translate it.  Apart from being a lot of work, this would effectively
isolate that copy from the rapid pace of improvements to the main code.
