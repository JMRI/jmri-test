<h1>JMRI Configuration</h1>

This is a "technical" page of the JMRI website.  Eventually we have to organize it better!
<P>
This page discusses the Spring 2002 effort to add configuration persistance to JMRI.
<P>
See also the 
<A HREF="index.html">base page</a> for technical documentation.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

We want to be able to:
<UL>
<LI>Save and restore program configuration information
<LI>Have the stored info be in a human readable format so that people
can check that it's correct
<LI>Have reasonable possibility for manual edits of the configuration info
<LI>Keep the effort to write configuration code reasonable
<LI>Preserve some possibility of changing the storage method and format
</UL>
<P>
XML seems the clear choice for readability, edits, and future flexibility.  
We previously used XML for the storage of decoder and programmer definitions, and that
went OK.  We'll therefore build on that, changing as needed.
