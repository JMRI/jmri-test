<H1>JMRI Names and Naming</H1>

This page discusses how JMRI objects are named, how those names are
used to reference the objects (hardware and software), and 
how user-readable names are used.

<h2>What's in a name?</h2>

Why do we need names at all, rather than pointers?
There are several uses that seem important:
<OL>
<LI>When working with user input, e.g. typing a number in a field, 
the code will need to find how to map the user-provided info
onto objects. Sometimes the user will want to name objects
with arbitary user names, e.g. "East Lockport Turnout". 
These can't be known until their mapping to hardware has been made. 
But other times these will be de-novo indentifications that the 
code must understand, e.g. something that means "LocoNet Turnout 23".

<LI>We imagine that configurations will be stored in XML files,
in a symbolic form. Names are a convenient way to connect objects
and object references in that kind of configuration.
</OL>

<H2>Items with names</h2>
There are lots of things that might need names:
<UL>
<LI>Aspects for signals
<LI>Blocks
<LI>Input Sensors
<LI>Locomotive Decoders (which includes "virtual" addresses like consists)
<LI>Outputs
<LI>Power districts and subdistricts
<LI>Signal heads
<LI>Turnouts
</UL>

Some of these are associated with a specific hardware device, e.g. a particular
turnout.  Others are more virtual, e.g. a signal aspect.

<P>
In all cases, we want users to be able to call things what they want.
Names like "p(24,23)*" are not useful.  Every named item will therefore
have a "user name", which is an entirely free-form string.

<P>
At the same time, we need a shorthand name, really a unique identifier, 
to talk about specific objects.  This doesn't have to be convenient, but
does have to have a clear mapping from name to object and back.  For example,
we need a very specific way to identify "LocoNet Turnout 23".  We call these
"system names".  JMRI code will map these to and form whatever information
the hardware may need, so we can specify them here.

<H2>Hardware names</h2>

A system-name is formed from a single letter representing the hardware system, 
followed by a single letter indicating the type, 
followed by system- and type-specific string. 
The string is meant to be related to the hardware addressing, but
is otherwise unconstrained.
<P>
Examples:
<UL>
<LI>LT23 - <u>L</u>ocoNet <u>T</u>urnout <u>23</u>.  
<LI>CS12 - The <u>12</u>th <u>C</u>/MRI <u>I</u>nput line
</ul>

Note that there is no assumption of pattern to the names; they don't have
to be assigned monotonically, nor are they restricted to a single system.

<H3>Hardware system letters</h3>
Note that some of these are placeholders, and have no underlying implementation. 

<ul>
<LI>C C/MRI serial
<LI>D Direct-packet-drive
<LI>E EasyDCC
<LI>I Internal, e.g. objects with no associated hardware
<LI>L LocoNet
<LI>N NCE (also Wangrow currently)
<LI>S SPROG
<LI>T Train-Brain
<LI>X XpressNet via LI100
</ul>

<H3>Device type letters</h3>
Note that some of these are placeholders, and have no underlying implementation. Also, 
there is no guarantee that any given hardware system will ever implement all of them.

<ul>

<LI>H Signal Head - One part of a signal (which may have multiple heads).  
Also interpreted to include indicators on control panels that
are acting to display signal aspects

<LI>L DCC Locomotive decoder - generally, a specific DCC address

<LI>P Power manager i.e. layout, district, subdistrict; not all systems 
distinguish between these,
so the device type letter doesn't either.  The system-specific part of the name
can. For example, the system specific part might be B for main layout power, e.g. 
LPB or S42 for subdistrict channel 2 on card 4, e.g. LPS42.

<LI>S Sensors - general purpose input sensors. It's not clear whether this includes, 
i.e. is a superset of, 
other specific inputs like occupancy detectors.

<LI>T Turnout - actually a general purpose output on the layout
</ul>


<H2>Notes</h2>
<UL>
<LI>
"Internal" objects can still be addressed and manipulated, but they don't have a strict
correspondence with some hardware on the layout.  For example, if a signal head
is implemented as three different outputs, LT1, LT2 and LT3, the signal head object
might be called IH3

<LI>Some devices are not really named, as there's no idea of more than one yet.
The DCC programmer is the first example, but there may be others.

<LI>The system name convention doesn't provide an easy way to identify more
than one adapter of a given type.  E.g. if you're connected to more than
one LocoNet, or more than one command station of any single type, that feed
separate parts of a single layout, how do you address this? 

<LI>Similarly, there's no provision for a single program to deal with more
than one layout.  If that's needed, we'll have to understand what 
the program is trying to do.
</UL>

<h2>System-specific info</H2>
Each different hardware system can specify the "string" that follows the system and type 
letters.  Generally, these are small numbers, but their exact meaning is very system-specific.
