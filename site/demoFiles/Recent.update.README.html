If you don't have that, please see the JMRI and DecoderProREADME files for how to download and install it:<UL><LI>DecoderPro: <A HREF="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/demoFiles/DecoderPro.README.html">http://jmri.sourceforge.net/demoFiles/DecoderPro.README.html</a>  <LI>JMRI demo: <A HREF="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/demoFiles/JMRIdemo.README.html">http://jmri.sourceforge.net/demoFiles/JMRIdemo.README.html</a></UL><P>  To install this update, copy the "jmri.jar" file and the "xml" directoryto your existing DecoderPro or JmriDemo directory.  If you haven't written your own decoder files, that's all that's needed!<P>If you have your own decoder files, you need to remake the indexby starting the program and selecting "Create index file" from thetools menu.<P><h3>New features in this update:</h3><UL><LI>EasyDCC support has been tested, and should now be working well.<LI>Additional Soundtraxx, Lenz and NCE decoders.<LI>You can now select register, paged or direct mode for programmingif your command station supports them.  This lets you program MRC andother register-mode-only decoders.<LI>Improved automatic identification of decoders, especially caseswhere the version number isn't unique or isn't recognized.<LI>Programmer window will no longer appear behind the Start Bar on Windows.<LI>Can now build the libraries and application with the Ant commandline tool.<LI>Now properly handles older locomotive files with newer decoderfiles, which lets us update definitions in place.</UL><h3>New features in the 0.9.2 update, also included here:</h3><UL><LI>Updated Soundtraxx DSD/DSX Diesel definitions to fix a programming error  <LI>Cleaned up LocoIO programmer interface</UL><h3>New features in the 0.9.1 update, also included here:</H3><UL><LI>Additional decoder definitions:  <UL><LI>Many Lenz decoders, courtesy Debbie Ames and Lenz USA<LI>Updates to Soundtraxx decoders, additional types</UL><li>New EasyDCC support in DecoderPro and the JMRI tools  <li>LocoIO programmer for both early (1.3.2) and later (1.3.4) LocoIO PIC code.  <li>Initial support in JMRI libraries for:<ul><li>Remote LocoNet server and client<li>CTC panel edit, store, load<li>C/MRI serial attachment</UL>Note that these are still in development, and should not be considered  ready for general use.  <LI>Various minor bug fixes and updates, including reduced memory usage andimproved error logging.  </UL><HR><BR>Site hosted by: <BR><A href="http://sourceforge.net"> <IMG src="http://sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?group_id=26788&type=1" width="88" height="31" border="0" alt="SourceForge Logo"> </A> <script language=javascript src="http://ss.webring.com/navbar?f=j;y=bob_jacobsen15;u=100088115910095949"></script><noscript><center><table bgcolor=gray cellspacing=0 border=2 bordercolor=red><tr><td><table cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0><tr><td align=center><font face=arial size=-1>This site is a member of WebRing. <br>To browse visit <a href="http://ss.webring.com/navbar?f=l;y=bob_jacobsen15;u=100088115910095949">Here</a>.</font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></center></noscript><hr>Bob Jacobsen<BR>jake@physics.berkeley.edu</body></html>
