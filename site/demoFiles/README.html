<PRE>

This is version 0.7 of "JMRI Demo".

This demo provides monitoring  and programming tools for a 
Digitrax LocoNet network. 

For more information, visit the JMRI web page at http://jmri.sourceforge.net/
or contact Bob Jacobsen (jake@physics.berkeley.edu). 

For more installation information, please 
see http://jmri.sourceforge.net/InstallJmri.html


Macintosh instructions:
=======================

This demo should run with any recent release of the Macintosh Runtime for Java (MRJ).  
MRJ requires Mac OS 8.1 or later.  Development is currently using MRJ 2.2.5, 
available for download from Apple at
  http://developer.apple.com/java/download.html

Start the demo by double-clicking on the "JMRI Demo" application icon.  



OS/2 instructions:
==================

You need to have Java (at least 1.2), Swing and javacomm installed on your 
machine. These can be downloaded from the IBM site.

Download the JMRI.demo.0.7.zip file and expand it with 

   PKZIP -extr -dir JMRI.demo.0.7.zip

Change to the directory just created, then run the JmriDemo.CMD  
script from this directory with

   JmriDemo
     

Linux instructions:
===================

You need to have Java 1.2 or later installed on your machine, including Swing.  
You can get this from Sun at
  http://java.sun.com/j2se/
For information on installing Java, please see 
  http://jmri.sourceforge.net/Java/InstallJava.html

To communicate with a LocoNet, you need to have a version of the javax.comm 
package installed on your computer.  One is available at 
  http://www.interstice.com/kevinh/linuxcomm.html
with additional information at
  http://www.rxtx.org/

Download the JMRI.demo.0.7.tar.gz file, then unpack it with
   gunzip JMRI.demo.0.7.tar.gz
   tar xf JMRI.demo.0.7.tar
      
Switch to the demo directory and run the demo using

  ./JmriDemo.csh
  

Windows instructions:
=====================

You need to have Java 1.2 or later installed on your machine, including Swing.  
You can get this from Sun at
  http://java.sun.com/j2se/
For information on installing Java, please see 
  http://jmri.sourceforge.net/Java/InstallJava.html

To communicate with a LocoNet, you need to have a version of the javax.comm package 
installed on your computer.  One is available at 
  http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm/

Download the JMRI.demo.0.7.zip file and expand it with WinZip or similar.
Change to the directory just created and do

  java -jar jmri.jar -classpath lib/log4j.jar;lib/xerces.jar;lib/jdom-jdk11.jar;${CLASSPATH}
  
  
LocoNet Hardware Connection:
===================

Connect a LocoBuffer or Digitrax MS100 interface to a serial port, using 
an adapter cable as needed.  For more information on the MS100, please see
  http://www.digitrax.com/computer.htm
For more information on the LocoBuffer, please see
  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/loconet_hackers/files/LocoBuffer/
  
The demo program is tested on a USB Macintosh using a Keyspan PDA Adapter to 
provide the serial port; for information please see 
http://jmri.sourceforge.net/DigiTrax/KeyspanAdapters/KeyspanUSB.html.  
Its not known if a standard Macintosh RS422 serial port will work directly 
with an MS100; if you have a pre-USB Macintosh and want to use this demo, please 
contact us for more information.

See below if you don't have a hardware connection to a LocoNet layout available.

Operating the demo (all platforms):
===================================

After the program starts, pull down the left "Input" menu 
and select "MS100" or "LocoBuffer", depending on your hardware. (See 
below if you don't have a hardware connection to a LocoNet layout available)

Select the name of the port connected to your LocoNet.

Click "Open LocoNet port"

You can now pull down the right "LocoNet" menu and select "LocoNet Monitor" to open 
a LocoNet monitor frame.  You should immediately start seeing LocoNet traffic 
in the top pane, which contains the last 20 messages. The controls at the bottom 
allow you to display raw data in addition to the interpreted packets, to clear the 
listing, and to write output to a log file.

The right and center menus have additional tools for interacting with your LocoNet:

"Turnout Control" - a window to control and monitor a single turnout.  You can have as 
many of these open as you'd like.  

"Simple Programmer" - a window to use the command station's programming track to 
read or write a single CV at a time.  Paged, Direct and Register modes are available, 
but not yet Ops Mode.

"Symbolic Programmer" - a window for programming decoders in terms of 
specific functions.  For more information, please see 
http://jmri.sourceforge.net/SymbProg/index.html

"LocoNet Commands" -  a window what allows limited interaction with the LocoNet. It 
contains buttons for sending "power on", "power off" and "turnout request" messages 
to the LocoNet.  

"Slot Monitor" - Displays the contents of the command station slots.  These 
are used by throttles to control locomotives.  If you uncheck the box at the top, 
only slots corresponding to active locomotives will be visible.

If you don't have an MS100 or LocoBuffer connection to a LocoNet layout 
available, you can still see the demo run by selecting "Hexfile" from 
the left "Input" menu.  When you then click "read  from file" the program will 
pretend that LocoNet traffic is arriving from a file of captured messages.  
The lnpacket.hex file is provided as an example.

Notes: 
======
 
Some hardware may not support the LocoNet baud rate.  If so, please let me know the 
specifics so I can create a workaround. 

I would also appreciate help with creating installers for Linux, Windows and 
other platforms.
