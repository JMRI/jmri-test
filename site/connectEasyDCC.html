<h2>Connecting to an EasyDCC system</h2>

To connect your computer to an EasyDCC system, you just connect the 
command station to the computer's serial
port using a 9-pin serial cable.
<P>
Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program.  This opens 
automatically the first time a program is run, or you can select it from
the "Edit" menu.  
<P>
Select "EasyDCC" from the top selection box. You can then
select the proper serial port in the second selection box.  
<P>
The baud
rate selection box will be fixed at 9600 baud.
<P>
The series of radio buttons labelled "GUI style" allows you to select
how the program will look.  
"Metal" is the native Java look available on all types. 
Other choices will vary with your computer type. "Motif", "Windows", "MacOS" 
and "MacOS Adaptive" look native on Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic" and MacOS X
respectively.
<P>
In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default programmer format. You can
override this each time you open the programmer, so this is here just for convenience.
<P>
Click "Save".  You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to quit, click "Yes".
<P>
Restart the program. You should be up and running.
<P>
Some older EasyDCC systems may need an update to their program.  This is 
done by replacing the "PROM" chips 
in the command station with a newer version.  Version 207 is
known to work well, and version 022 is known to have some problems 
communicating with a computer.  
Most recent command stations will be OK.
<P>
If you have trouble getting the program to talk to your command station,
ask for help on the JMRI users mailing list
(<A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/</a>) 
and we'll help you sort all this out.
