In this case, the <b>Kick Start</b>, <b>Acceleration rate</b>,<b>DecelerationRate</b>, and <b>Speed Stabilization</b> (Digitrax's Back EMF) CVs arelisted here.<p><b>Kick Start </b>is an extra burst of power to help start balky motors.Compare this to the "<b>Minimum Voltage</b>" CV we'll see in the next pane,which is a sustained increased level of power. Between the two it is quitepossible to tune a decent quality locomotive so that it creeps at lessthan a tie a minute.<p><b>Acceleration and deceleration rates</b> help simulate a locomotiveunder load - but don't use them unless you have very clean track, becausean interruption of power can make a locomotive stop and cycle through theaccelleration curve again! High decelleration rates can make station stopsand switching realistic, but <u>very</u> challenging!<p>Every manufacturer implements "<b>Back EMF</b>" or "<b>Speed Stabilization</b>"differently. See your decoder documentation for the best ways to implementthese variables, and be prepared to do a lot of experimenting! Howeverthey do it and whatever they call it, you should find it here.<p><hr WIDTH="100%"><br>&nbsp;<div align=right><a href="Comp_Speed.html">On to Next Section</a></div><div align=right><a href="Index.html#Advanced Programmer">Back to Index</a></div></body></html>
