Since it's highly unlikely that you'd havegotten this far if you were a quitter, click on the "<b>Continue</b>" button.You'll see this screen:<center><p><img SRC="Pix/Set_up.JPG" ALT="Set Up Screen" NOSAVE BORDER=5 height=572 width=521></center><div align=right><a href="Index.html#Basic Programmer">Back to Index</a></div><h2><a NAME="Select Decoder"></a>How to select the right decoder programmer</h2>With the decoder-equipped locomotive on the programming track, click onthe "<b>Ident</b>" button towards the middle ot the window on the righthand side, right across from "<b>Decoder Installed</b>". DecoderPro willattempt to identify the decoder in the locomotive by asking it what itis! This can take a little bit of time - since the decoder can only answer"yes" or "no", the software has to play "Twenty Questions" with it fora while to get the right answers. When the program finds the correct decoder,it will display it in the appropriate section of the white portion of thewindow and the "<b>Open Programmer</b>" button will become active.<p><font color="#660000">This method will only work if your command stationis capable of reading back CVs. Many lower end and/or older systems donot provide this capability. If the command station cannot read CVs fromthe programming track, then you will have to select the decoder manuallyfrom the list provided as described below. If DecoderPro knows your systemcannot read CVs, then the <b>Ident</b> buttons will not be available.</font><p>If you have a decoder that hasn't been added to the list yet, DecoderPromight not come up with the specific decoder. In this case, open the manufacturer'sfolder and find the right decoder or one closely related. Another optionwould be to open the NMRA decoder, a generic standard file that (for basicprogramming, at least) should cover your needs.<p>Note that in this example the "<b>Programmer format</b>" has been setto "<b>Basic</b>". This is a good place to start if you're new to DCC decoderprogramming, because you won't be able to do much damage if you make mistakes.<p>Once you've selected a decoder, or DecoderPro has done it for you, the"<b>Open Programmer</b>" button will be activated. Click on it to moveto the next step.<div align=right><a href="Index.html#Basic Programmer">Back to Index</a></div><h1><a NAME="Basic Programmer"></a>The Basic Programmer</h1><h2><a NAME="Roster"></a>The Roster Entry Screen</h2>A <b>roster</b> is a simply a database of all locomotives that your installationof DecoderPro has programmed. It includes the information seen in the screenbelow:<center><p><img SRC="Pix/Basic_Roster.JPG" ALT="Basic Programmer Roster Tab" NOSAVE BORDER=5 height=493 width=521></center><p><br><br><br><p>Most of these fields are self-explanatory. However, note that the firstfield (<b>ID</b>) becomes the file name for the locomotive. I like to usethe locomotive number, two spaces, and then the locomotive type for thisfield. In the event I want to look something up later or restore some datathat got corrupted it makes things easier. The "<b>Comment</b>" field isa good place to put the date you purchased the locomotive, price, or anyother information you might feel is important to record.<p>The "<b>Save</b>" button writes the current decoder information to thedrive and folder where the program is installed.<p>The "<b>Reset to Defaults</b>" button returns the values <u>i<b>n thecomputer</b></u> to those that would be in the decoder as shipped fromthe factory. It does <b><u><font color="#FF0000">not</font></u></b> writethose values to the decoder! To do so, you would have to press either the"<b>Write Sheet</b>" or "<b>Write All</b>" buttons.<p>At the bottom of the window there are several programming mode options:<font color="#660000"><b>PagedMode</b>, <b>Direct Bit</b>, <b>Direct Byte</b>,<b>Register Mode</b>,and <b>Address Mode</b>.&nbsp;</font> For most newer decoders, stay with"P<b>aged Mode</b>"<font color="#660000"> or whichever Direct mode yourCommand Station supports. </font>Your decoder documentation will let youknow if programming in some other mode is necessary.<br>&nbsp;<h2><a NAME="Programming Modes"></a><font color="#660000">Some brief commentson Programming modes</font></h2><font color="#660000"><b>Address Mode</b> is an outdated programming methodthat is included here for the sake&nbsp; of full compliance with the NMRADCC standard. <b>Register Mode</b> is an expanded form of Address Mode,and is still used by some older and/or lower end decoders, particularysome from MRC and Wangrow. It is inherently limited in its ability to accessall CVs in a decoder.&nbsp; <b>Paged Mode</b> is an expansion of Registermode that gives full access to all decoder CVs. <b>Direct Mode</b> is anothermethod, not yet supported by all decoders, that allows full access. TheAD4 Accessory Decoder can <b><u>only</u></b> be programmed in <b>DirectMode</b>. There are two ways of implementing <b>Direct Mode</b>. The buttonfor the method(s) your command station supports will be activated.</font><p><font color="#660000">If you experience difficulty programming a decoderin Paged Mode, try Direct Mode, then Register Mode, and finally AddressMode.</font><div align=right><a href="Index.html#Basic Programmer">Back to Index</a></div><h2><a NAME="Basic 2"></a>Using the Basic Programmer</h2>At the top of the window are two tabs: "Roster Entry" and "Basic". We havebeen working in the "Roster Entry" pane of the window. Now, click on the"Basic" tab to change panes. You will see a screen similar to the following:<center><p><img SRC="Pix/Basic_Program.JPG" ALT="Basic Programming Pane" NOSAVE BORDER=5 height=492 width=520></center><p>You will see three options you can change, highlighted in yellow:<ul><li>The decoder address (should be unique among your locomotives)</li><li>Extended addressing (enables 4 digit DCC addresses)</li><li>Analog operation (enables the decoder running under regular DC voltage/Analogcontrol)</li></ul>The yellow highlighting indicates these options are either "probable" settingsand have not been confirmed from the decoder, or are settings that havebeen changed by the user and have not been written back to the decoder.&nbsp;<a NAME="Read Data"></a>Toread the actual settings for these options, click on the "R<b>ead Sheet</b>"button. The individual settings will turn red while they are in the processof being read, and will turn white once the values have been read sucessfullyfrom the decoder. Once again, DecoderPro must play "Twenty Questions" toget this information, and sometimes even has to ask a couple of times.Be patient, especially with older computers. At the very bottom of thepane (where it says "i<b>dle</b>") you will see a running account of exactlywhat DecoderPro is doing.<p><font color="#660000">Again, the <b>Read sheet</b> and <b>Read all</b>functions are dependant on your command station. If your system does nothave the capability to read CVs, then these buttons will not be available.</font><p><a NAME="Enter/Edit data"></a>If you wish to change the address of thelocomotive, simply click in the text box and type in the new address. Toturn on or off 4 digit addressing, click on the check box. To enable/disableanalog (regular DC) operation, select the appropriate entry from the pulldownmenu.&nbsp;<a NAME="Write Data"></a>When you are finished, click on "<b>WriteSheet</b>" to send the new values to the decoder. It's that easy!<p>Writing <u>usually</u> takes much less time than reading, because thevalue can be sent directly. As the write operation proceeds, the data willchange from yellow to white. If there is difficulty writing to the decoder,the data will change to red. The software will automatically keep tryinguntil the write operation is sucessful.<p><a NAME="Save Data"></a>To finish this "basic" programming of a decoder,click once more on the "<b>Roster Entry</b>" tab, then click on the "<b>Save</b>"button. Your new decoder settings have now been written not only to thedecoder, but also saved to a computer file where they may be recalled inthe future. You may now close the programming pane.<p>If you forget to write the settings to the decoder, or to save the fileto the computer, you will be prompted to do so when you close the programmingpane. You may elect not to do so.<p><a NAME="Do More"></a>Now, let's explore the <a href="Comp_Setup_Roster.html">ComprehensiveProgrammer</a>!<div align=right><a href="Index.html#Basic Programmer">Back to Index</a></div><br>&nbsp;</body></html>
