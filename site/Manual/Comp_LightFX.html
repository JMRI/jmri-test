While fine-tuning the motor is important, and speed tableshelp add to the realism of operation, everyone notices the lights - especiallywhen they change intensity, flicker, flash, or fade. They attract evenmore attention when, for example, the ditch lights that were steadily shiningas the locomotive approached the crossing suddenly begin flashing alternately,then return to a steady glow; or when a locomotive pulls into a siding,stops, and dims its headlight for the approaching train.<p><img SRC="Pix/Comp_06_Lights.JPG" ALT="Comprehensive Programmer - Lighting Functions Pane" NOSAVE BORDER=5 height=597 width=832><p>The specific effects available differ widely between manufacturers,and even between different "families" of decoders from the same maker.The above example is from a Digitrax FX decoder. Some of the advanced featuresyou will see in many decoders (though they may go by different but similarnames) are <b>Lamp Keep-Alive Voltage</b>, <b>FX Rate Adjust</b>, and <b>DitchLight Hold-over Time</b>.<p>The <b>Lamp Keep-Alive Voltage</b> determines how dark a light getsbetween "full on" moments. This can let you adjust effects to give theimpression of, for example, a marker light that also has a rotary beaconin the same housing. Play with this value and see what kind of resultsyou get for your specific decoder.<br>&nbsp;<p><b>FX RATE Adjust</b> controls how fast an FX effect operates. The higherthe number, the slower the frequency of flash or "rotation" of the effect.I use this to set subtle differences between my locomotives. As you cansee from the panel above, I use twin alternating strobe lights on my engines.I vary the setting for the <b>FX Rate</b> slightly so that my locomotivesflash at slightly different rates. This keeps MU'd units from looking <u>too</u>coordinated!<p>The <b>Ditch Light Hold-over Time</b> CV establishes how long the ditchlighteffect (alternating flashing) stays activated after you hit the <b>F2</b>function key. Since the <b>F2</b> key is non-latching (think of it as amomentary contact switch) it normally turns off when it is released. Byraising the value of this CV you can make them stay on for up to 30 secondsfrom a single momentary activation.<p>The other lighting effects are highly variable between decoders. Checkyour specific decoder documentation for what the decoder is supposed tobe capable of, and have fun playing with them. They are the most visuallysatisfying of all the capabilities of the decoders!<p><hr WIDTH="100%"><br>&nbsp;<div align=right><a href="Comp_Consist.html">On to Next Section</a></div><div align=right><a href="Index.html#Advanced Programmer">Back to Index</a></div></body></html>
