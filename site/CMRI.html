<H1>JMRI and C/MRI together</H1>

The JMRI libraries have built-in support for C/MRI serial hardware.
C/MRI inputs can be used as sensors, and outputs can be driven as
turnouts.

<h2>Use with an SMINI board</h2>

It's easiest to try JMRI with a SMINI board, as there's no options to 
be configured for the C/MRI hardware.
<OL>
<LI>Start the JMRIdemo program
<LI>From the edit menu, select preferences and configure:
   <UL>
   <LI>Protocol as "C/MRI serial"
   <LI>For serial port, select the one your hardware is attached to.
   <LI>Select the baud rate your C/MRI system uses
   <LI>Select "SMINI" from the initialization box
   <LI>Click save, and say yes when it asks if you want to quit.
   </UL>
<LI>Restart the JMRIdemo program. Your SMINI's red and yellow LEDs should now
be flashing, indicating that the computer and SMINI are talking.
<LI>To check that everything is working, select "Turnout Control" from the tools
menu.  This will open a small window in which you can select a turnout number
(<a href="#numbers">see below</a>), then click closed/thrown to change the state
of that output.
</OL>


<h2>Use with other C/MRI hardware</h2>

A C/MRI system needs an initialization string before it can
communicate.  	Look at C/MRI in July 1986 MRr, which says 
the format of the initialization message is:

<PRE>
	0x41  UA+65, starting with UA 0
	0x49  "I" for initialization
	0x4E  "N" CRC not enabled
	0x01  delay MSByte
	0x09  delay LSByte  (units are 10usec)
	0x01  NS=1   Number of card-Sets-of-four
	0x02  CT(1) = 2  (up to NS items appear here)
	            each CT value is set of 4 2-bit fields coded 
	            0=no-card, 1=input-card, 2=output-card, 3=reserved
	            LS2bits is card in slot 1 of the set of four, 
	            MS2bits is card in slot 4 of the set of four
</PRE>
(The sofware puts the STX, DLE and ETX characters
as needed to frame the packet). More recent hardware, like the SMINI, 
use slightly different messages. 
<P>
For example, a system with 8 input cards would have:
<PRE>
 41 49 4E 01 09 02 55 55
</PRE>
<P>
Nick Kulp's Cornwall Railroad has 2 output cards, then 2 input cards,
then three output cards, an input card, and one more output cards.
It uses the string:
<PRE>
 41 49 4E 00 0A 03 5A 9A 02
</PRE>
<P>
Note that you're referring to the cards by the addresses set on them,
not by their position on the motherboard.
<P>
Enter the initialization message for your system in the preferences
panel, and then restart the program.

<A id="numbers"><h2>Numbering</h2></a>

C/MRI system names start with "C".  For example, "CS24" is a C/MRI "S"ensor, the 24th 
input line.
<P>
Inputs and outputs are numbered sequentially from 1, without 
worrying about the types of cards, etc.  For example, if you have
two 24-input cards, CS25 refers to the 1st input line on the second card.
If you have two 32 input cards, CS25 refers to the 25th input line on the
first card.
