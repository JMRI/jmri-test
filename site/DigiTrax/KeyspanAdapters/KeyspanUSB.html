   <title>USB Serial Adapters and the MS100</title>
</head>
<body>

This page describes tests of two USB serial adapters with the Digitrax 
MS100 LocoNet interface.
<P>
The MS100 is a passive level shifter that gets its power from the
control leads in the RS232 interface.  Digitrax has not published a
schematic, but Bill Robinson of Team Digital has graciously provided
a 
<A HREF="../LN_to_PC.gif">schematic of their level shifter<a>
which is thought to be very similar.

<h2>Keyspan PDA adapter P/N USA-19</h2>

Summary: This worked fine.

<P>
Unfortunately, this adapter is no longer made.  I believe that
the replacement "Keyspan High Speed Serial Adapter" Part# USA-19QW 
is the same unit.

<P>
This was actually the second USB serial adapter I tried, after the Keyspan Dual
Serial Adapter (see below).  This adapter provides a DB9 male plug, 
pinout available from the 
<A HREF="http://www.keyspan.com/products/USB/PDAadapter/docs/mac/html/homepage29.html">Keyspan product support page</A>.
Note that there are both RTS and DTR outputs; these can be separately controlled
to provide + and - voltage to the MS100.

<P>I connected it through a DB9 female to DB25 male adapter cable 
that I happened to have, and the test program was immediately 
able to communicate with the LocoNet.

<h3>DB9 female to DB25 male connections</h3>

RI       9            22

</PRE>

<P> Note that I didn't test the level input from the MS100 (DSR, CTS).

<P>We've had a report that this PDA adapter can't work with a LocoBuffer at 57,600
baud.  There seem to be multiple versions of the adapter, with slightly different model
numbers, and it could be that some of them will only work to 56,000 baud.

<h2>Keyspan Dual Serial Adapter P/N USA-28X</h2>

Summary: This did not work.

<P>
The initial problem was that the USB adapter provides only one 
control line output (see pinout on the 
<A HREF="http://www.keyspan.com/products/USB/usa28x/docs/swp/aPinOuts.html">Keyspan product support page</A>.
This means that the serial port can only provide one of the two 
+ and - levels needed for the MS100.  Since there are
two ports, I build a small adapter to use the control line from the
second port to provide the other level.

<P>
The second problem was that the serial port outputs were only +/- 5V.
This was not enough to power the MS100 during receive.

<P>The following picture shows the transmit data levels from the 
Keyspan adapter.  DC levels had similar ranges.  This was a large 
enough swing to drive the LocoNet itself, but not to power the
receive level shifter in the MS100.

<P>


<P>Providing auxiliary +/- 9V power to the MS100, without using the
output lines as a power source, was not sufficient. 
The following picture is the received data, nominally an RS232
signal of at least +/-6 volts, from the MS100.
The received
data signal was getting up to 6V, marginally OK, but it was
not going below ground.  The USB serial adapter was not
reporting any received charaters to the Macintosh.

<h2>Hardware & software used</h2>

The tests were done with a PowerBook G4 400MHz, Mac OS 9.1.  The test 
program was a Java application created with CodeWarrior 4.1.0.3 build 661.
This program is available on request, see below for address.
Java access to the USB serial adapters was via Patrick Beard's Macintosh
implementation of javax.comm.  

<P>
The Digitrax system was a Chief, DT100IR throttle, and various
decoders on the layout.  Traffic from command station, throttle
and various auxiliary components (PM4, DS54) was available for testing.
