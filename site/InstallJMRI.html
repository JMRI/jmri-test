<H2>Installing the JMRI demos</H2>

Download the zipped version of the WIRED client code (about 7M)
to a fresh directory, such as c:\WiredBaBar.
<UL>
<LI>Through the web, you can find the file at the following location
(make sure the save dialog maintains the file extension as .zip,
some versions of NT have been seen to set this to .exe, you should force
it back to .zip):
<UL>

For JDK1.1:

</UL>
</UL>
<P>
Unzip the file into that same directory.
<UL>
<LI>
Special for Macintosh:
<UL>
<LI>
Unpack the WiredBaBarForMac_sea.bin file with your favorite utility.
A self-extracting archive will create a "Wired for Macintosh" folder.
The README file in that directory will tell you how to complete the install.
<LI>
Note that for now only the CES_ANALYSIS and CES_BETA startup procedures will
work as advertised, but once these applications are started you can change
to any other server through the event chooser.
</UL>
<LI>
Special for NT:
<UL>
<LI>
Set the environment variable "WIRED_HOME" to
the complete path of the top level Wired directory, such as "c:\WiredBaBar".
There should be no colon or semicolon after this directory name.
<LI>
NT users who have administrative privileges on their machines can make
this WIRED_HOME setting permanent by going to the
<UL>
<LI>
Start Menu...Settings...Control Panel...System...Environment
<LI>
Add a new Variable, "WIRED_HOME" (careful, make it all Caps)
<LI>
Set the value to something like
<LI>
C:\WiredBaBar
<LI>
Then be sure to BOTH hit the Apply button and then the OK button.
<LI>
All new command windows will then have these settings
(old ones will not get the new settings).
<LI>
To review the current settings in any command window, just type "set"
</UL>
</UL>
<LI>
Special for Unix or Linux:
<UL>
<LI>
Set the environment variable "WIRED_HOME" to
the complete path of the top level Wired directory, such as "c:/WiredBaBar".
There should be no colon or semicolon after this directory name.
<LI>
Set the executable bits on for every directory
in the application by going to the WiredBaBar directory and typing:
<PRE>
   find . -type d -exec chmod +x {} \;
</PRE>
</UL>

<HR><H2><A NAME="applicationupgrade">
To Upgrade to a Newer Copy of the BaBar WIRED Client Application</A></H2>
The client application is entirely self-contained; it does not add or
modify any files outside of its own file structure.
The upgrade procedure is therefore very simple.
<UL>
<LI>Delete the entire file structure of the old client copy
(if you have taken the defaults, this will be the structure that begins
with WiredBaBar).
<LI>Download a new client copy.
<LI>Rerun the install procedure as described above.
<LI>If you do the new installation to the same directory that had the old
installation, there will be no need to redo any environment variable settings.
</UL>


<HR><H2><A NAME="applicationrun">
To Run the BaBar WIRED Client Application</A></H2>

<H3>Starting WIRED</H3>
From the WiredBaBar/bin directory, start wired by typing the command:
<PRE>
   WiredBaBar/bin> wired
</PRE>
<UL>
<LI>Special for SLAC Unix or Linux:
<UL>
<LI>If you have the standard BaBar setup,
you can just type "wired" from any directory.
</UL>
<LI>Special for Macintosh:
<UL>
<LI>Just click on one of the application icons created by the
installation procedure.
<LI>
Note that for now only the CES_ANALYSIS and CES_BETA startup procedures will
work as advertised, but once these applications are started you can change
to any other server through the event chooser.
</UL>
<LI>Special for NT:
<UL>
<LI>If you add the WiredBaBar/bin directory to your PATH
(following the same procedure as was described earlier to
<A HREF="index.html#setntenv">set CLASSPATH</A>),
you can also start Wired by selecting
"wired.bat" from the Start menu's "Wired BaBar" program group.
