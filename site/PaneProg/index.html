<H2>DecoderPro Symbolic Programmer</h2>

Modern DCC decoders are complicated beasts to program.  
The simple idea of "put the address in CV01" doesn't cope well when you 
program complicated functions using combinations of bit patterns.  A friendlier
interface is needed.  There are programs that provide better ways of programming 
specific decoders.  Unfortunately, they are limited to specific types of computers, and
only their authors can customize them for new types of decoders.
<P>
The DecoderPro symbolic programmer is meant to improve this. It is configured 
using text files, so that it can be adapted to additional decoder types easily.
It talks to the decoders using the JMRI programming interface, so that it can
run on any computer and layout hardware that JMRI has been ported to.  And since
the code is available via open source, if you want to improve on it you can.

<P><B>Please note that Decoder Pro is still a work-in-progress!  
We're providing occasional development distributions so that people
can see how it works, comment on how they'd prefer it to work, and
help us debug it.  But we don't expect anything complete, robust or reliable
until Summer 2002. Thank you for your patience!</B>
<h3>A quick tour</h3>

When you first open the programmer, you see a window like this:
<p>
<IMG SRC="images/BlankSetup.gif" WIDTH="436" HEIGHT="234" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0">
<p>

You use this to configure the programmer with information about a specific
type of decoder, or an existing locomotive.  For example, to 
start working with a newly-installed decoder, you need to tell
the programmer the decoder type so it can load information
about the available settings.
You can manually select the 
decoder type from the selection box:
<p>
<IMG SRC="images/SelDecoder.gif" WIDTH="436" HEIGHT="234" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0">
<p>
You can also click the adjacent "Ident" button to have the programmer
read the decoder and attempt to identify it.   
While the 
programmer is talking to the decoder, status will be displayed in
the bottom of the window; "Idle" or "OK" means that things are working.
If it succeeds, it 
will select the decoder model in the selection box.  Usually
it will only be able to narrow the selection down to a few choices.
Pull down the "Decoder installed" selection box and check that the
right model is selected.  
<P>
Some people prefer a very simple programmer, and some want to 
have access to every feature. To handle this, DecoderPro
provides several displays.  
<p>
<IMG SRC="images/SelProg.gif" WIDTH="436" HEIGHT="234" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0">
<p>
As shipped, it comes with:
<DL>
<DT>Basic<DD>A simple one, with just the most popular information
<DT>Comprehensive<DD>The most complete display, with multiple panes 
of detailed information.
<DT>Registers<DD>Complete configuration for a register-only decoder
<DT>Tutorial<DD>Not useful for actually programming decoders, 
this contains examples of how various special effects can
be obtained when you're constructing your own programmer.
</DL>
You can even define your own format if you'd prefer to just see
the variables you use.  For this first pass through the program,
we select "Comprehensive" in the lowest selection box.

<P>
Then, click "Open Programmer" to start working with the decoder.
The actual programmer opens in a large window (shown reduced in size):
<p>
<IMG SRC="images/BasicPaneY75.gif" WIDTH="618" HEIGHT="388" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0">
<p>

Each of the tabs selects a screen you can use to configure
different aspects of the decoder.  The "Basic" pane
handles the address other settings you'll usually need. 
Using the buttons on the bottom of each screen are buttons
that will read values from or write values to the decoder.
For example, to do a basic configuration, enter values in the 
fields and click "Write sheet".  

<P>The variable fields are color coded to represent their states:
<DL>
<DT>Editted<DD>You've changed this value, or it contains default
values from the decoder file.  This is shown as yellow, since the
value differs from what's in the decoder.
<DT>From File<DD>The field contains values read from a
locomotive file.  This is also shown as yellow, since we're not
certain that the file agrees with the decoder contents.
<DT>Read<DD>The value shown has been read from the decoder.
This is shown as white to indicate that the value is trustworthy.
<DT>Stored<DD>The value show has been written to the decoder.
This is also shown as white.
<DT>Unknown<DD>If something goes wrong with the read or write process,
we might have a completely untrustworthy result.  This results in
the variable's state being marked as UNKNOWN and shown as red.
</DL>
<P>
For example, after a "Read all" the speed table values are shown as 
white:
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/SpeedTableW75.gif" WIDTH="618" HEIGHT="387" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0">
<P>
When you modify a value, its marked as yellow:
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/ModSpeedTable75.gif" WIDTH="618" HEIGHT="387" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0">
<P>
Doing a write will set it back to white; doing a read will reset the
value to the value in the decoder, and reset it to white.

<P>
Although having a name for an entire CV is nice, where this really helps is with
complicated bit-mapped options.  Digitrax FX lighting options, for example,
require configuring two sets of bits into one CV. 
Each selection box, checkbox or radiobutton is mapped to specific
bit(s) in the decoder's CVs.  The programmer handles the 
reading and writing of the CVs when the individual settings are changed.
Instead of bits, you're working with the name or description from the 
decoder manual. 

<P>
DecoderPro is meant to be easily configurable to add new 
types of decoders. You can also add programmer sheets, 
change their layout, and   
even redo the entire appearance.
To do that,
DecoderPro is driven by human-readable files in XML format.  
<A HREF="ConfigFile.html">Incomplete documentation</a> exists, and we hope to
update it soon (December 2001).
<P>
These files make it convenient to update DecoderPro to work
with a new decoder.  For example, the unique capabilities of a
Digitrax DH142 appear on a "Digitrax" sheet:
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/Digitrax75.gif" WIDTH="618" HEIGHT="387" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0">
<P>
Additional decoder-specific variables and sheets can be added
via configuration files. By choosing an industry-standard XML format for 
decoder information, we
hope to make it possible to create a complete library. Perhaps
we can even interest manufacturers in documenting their products in this format.

<P>
Its also possible to program the CVs directly:
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/CVtable75.gif" WIDTH="504" HEIGHT="448" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0">
<P>

<h3>Locomotive roster</h3>

DecoderPro maintains a roster of your locomotives.  You can save the
decoder configuration to a file, and then later work with CV values
from the file.  This saves the time it takes to read a complete 
decoder, which can be quite long. The roster can also store
locomotive information for you.  
The "Roster Entry" sheet displays this info and allows you to edit it:
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/Roster75.gif" WIDTH="618" HEIGHT="387" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0">
<P>
Click "Save" to store the information; you'll be reminded to do this
if you close the programmer with any unstored information.
<P>
The "ID" field at the top is the name you'll later use to select
this locomotive.  You can put whatever you'd like in it.
For example, during the startup, you can
select a specific locomotive to work with:
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/SelLoco.gif" WIDTH="434" HEIGHT="234" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0">
<P>
The "Ident" button uses the DCC address to select a specific locomotive in 
the roster.
When you click "Open Programmer" with a specific locomotive selected, the
programmer opens each sheet with the current values already present.

<h3>More information</h3>

<P>
<A HREF="MoreInfo.html">More information on how this works</a> is available, as is
<A HREF="../index.html">more information on other JMRI tools</A>.

<h3>Availability</h3>
The programmer is available in the current distributions of the JMRI libraries,
and separately packaged as the "DecoderPro" application. 
It works with Digitrax and NCE command stations.
For downloading and installation instructions, please read the 
<A HREF="../demoFiles/DecoderPro.README.html">README file</A>.
<B>This is very preliminary software;</B>
we're tenatively planning for something "of quality" by Summer 2002.

(An anonymous feature 
request started this whole effort! We take suggestions very seriously)
<P>
The <A href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-announce">jmri-announce</a> 
mailing list carries announcements of new versions, major changes, etc.  
This list is intended to be very low traffic; discussions, etc, should take place elsewhere.
