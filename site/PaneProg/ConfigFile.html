<H2>Configuration files for the DecoderPro Symbolic Programmer</h2>

This page provides a little information on how the configuration files
for the DecoderPro Symbolic Programmer work.
(Introductory information for the programmer is available on the 
<A HREF="index.html">prior page</A>)
For details on JMRI internals, please see the
<A HREF="../Technical/index.html" NAME="technical pages">technical pages</A>, which are unfortunately still
being written.

In the first section, we walk you through the process of creating a file to
describe a new file.
This section is first because we think that its the first thing that 
most people will want to do.  But you might benefit from reading 
the later sections to get background information, especially
the XML introduction and the section on what the configuration files contain.


<a id="createDecoder"><h3>Creating a custom decoder configuration file</h3></a>

The easiest way to create a configuration file is to 
modify an existing one.  In this section, we walk you 
through doing this.
<OL>
<LI>
Make a copy of a similar file.  Although you can
call this new file anything you like, it will work best
if you use the same convention as the provided files.  That's
<code>"manufacturer name"_"decoder family".xml</code>, for example:
<PRE>
    Digitrax_1x2.xml
    Atlas_DualMode.xml
</pre>
For the provided files, we use the same capitalization, etc, that the
decoder manufacturer uses in their documentation. 
<P>
This new file should go in the "decoders" subdirectory in the 
"JMRI" preferences directory so that the program can find it.
The "DecoderProConfig.xml" file
lives in the preferences directory, so you can search for that file to locate
it.
<A HREF="#files">A later section</a> provides further details about 
how to find that directory and it's contents. 

<LI>
Open the new file with your favorite editor.  You'll see something like this
at the top (the examples are from the <A HREF="../xml/Digitrax_1x2.xml">Digitrax_1x2.xml</A> file):
<PRE>
    &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
    &lt;!DOCTYPE decoder-config SYSTEM "decoder-config.dtd"&gt;
    &lt;!-- $Id: ConfigFile.html,v 1.18 2003-08-12 15:40:14 jacobsen Exp $ --&gt;
    &lt;decoder-config&gt;
</PRE>
Don't mess with these lines; they describe the format of the file.

<LI>
The next element describes the decoder file:
<PRE>
        &lt;version author="jake@physics.berkeley.edu" 
            version="1" lastUpdated="20011201"/&gt;
</PRE>
These attributes are only read by people, not the program, so their
exact format isn't critical.  But we encourage you to insert your email
address in files you create or change, so that if anybody has any questions
they can find you.  The version and lastUpdated attributes provide a 
way of telling different versions of a decoder definition apart, so we'd
also like you to update those.  For a new file, set the version back to "1",
and if you're modifying an existing file, increment the version attribute
to the next number.         

<LI>
The next lines identify the "family" of decoders that this file
describes:
<PRE>
    &lt;decoder&gt;
         &lt;family name="Digitrax 1x2" mfg="Digitrax"
                lowVersionID="240" highVersionID="242"
                comment="Digitrax DH142, etc" &gt;
            &lt;model model="DH142" numOuts="4" numFns="2"/&gt;
            &lt;model model="DN142" numOuts="4" numFns="2"/&gt;
            &lt;model model="DH083" numOuts="5" numFns="2"/&gt;
         &lt;/family&gt;
</PRE>
The spacing is not important, but its useful to ident the file like this to make it more readable.
XML uses "elements" and "attributes" to carry information.  The &lt;abc&gt; things are elements; attributes
are set to specific values within elements.  In the 2nd through 4th lines above
<PRE>
         &lt;family name="Digitrax 1x2" mfg="Digitrax"
                lowVersionID="240" highVersionID="242"
                comment="Digitrax DH142, etc" &gt;
</PRE>
the element is 'family', with attributes 'name', 'mfg', 'lowVersionID', 'highVersionID', and 'comment'.
An attribute is given a value with an equals sign and a value in quotes (the quotes are required).
The order of the attributes is not important, and you can break them across lines if that
makes the file easier to read. Note that all of the attributes must be inside the angle
brackets, and after the name of the element.
<P>
In this element, change the attributes to match your new decoder:
    <UL>
    <LI><dfn>name</dfn> - the name of the decoder family.  Its best if you use the same
    name here as you used in the filename.
    <LI><dfn>mfg</dfn> - the manufacturer of the decoder.  Its best if you use the same
    manufacturer name here as you used in the filename.
    <LI><dfn>lowVersionID</dfn>, <dfn>highVersionID</dfn> - 
        The manufacturer can load a version number into CV 7 of a
        decoder.  
        Not all manufacturers do this, but if one is available
        the programmer can check if
        this file is being used with the expected decoder type. 
        If only one value is valid, define the attribute
        lowVersionID, e.g. 
<PRE>
    lowVersionID="123"
</PRE>
        If the decoder type can have any one of a range of numbers,
        for example because the manufacturer has made some updates,
        define both attributes.
        If you don't know the version number, don't define
        either of these attributes.
    <LI><dfn>comment</dfn> - this is optional. You might want to include your name, or other
        info about the changes in the file.
    </UL>
<P>
The following lines:
<PRE>
            &lt;model model="DH142" numOuts="4" numFns="2"/&gt;
            &lt;model model="DN142" numOuts="4" numFns="2"/&gt;
            &lt;model model="DH083" numOuts="5" numFns="2"/&gt;
         &lt;/family&gt;
</PRE>
allow you to list a number of different decoder models that can use this
file.  For a single decoder, remove all but one of the "model" elements, 
and give it the model name of the decoder.  The numOuts and numFns are
described later, but for now you can just delete them, leaving something 
like:
<PRE>
            &lt;model model="DH142" /&gt;
         &lt;/family&gt;
</PRE>

<LI>
The next element defines what programming modes the decoder can understand:
    <PRE>
    &lt;programming direct="byteOnly" paged="yes" 
                         register="yes" ops="yes"&gt;&lt;/programming&gt;
    </PRE>
Paged, register and ops can be set to either "yes" or "no".  Direct can
be set to "no", "bitOnly", "byteOnly", or "yes".
The programmer uses this 
information to select the programming mode to use when working with a decoder.

<LI>
The next part of the file consists of a set of 'variable' elements
defining specific variables, nested inside
a 'variables' (note the extra "s") element. An example:
    <PRE>
    &lt;variable label="Short Address" CV="1" item="Primary Address" default="03"&gt;
        &lt;decVal min="1" max="127"/&gt;
        &lt;/variable&gt;
    </PRE>
Each variable represents one thing to configure.  They can represent 
a single CV, e.g. address, or a few bits that can be
configured to control a particular function.
If some of these aren't appropriate to your decoder, you can just remove them.
Make sure you remove the entire element from the &lt;variable&gt;
to the matching &lt;/variable&gt;.
You can also rearrange them if you'd prefer a different order.
<P>
The attributes include:
    <UL>
    <LI><dfn>label</dfn> - The name for this variable.
    <LI><dfn>item</dfn> - An alternative, 'standard' name. See below for
        more information on this.
    <LI><dfn>CV</dfn> - Which CV contains the configuration information
        for this variable.
    <LI><dfn>mask</dfn> - A pattern like "XXXVVVXX" which controls which
        bits in the CV make up the variable. Each "V" is a bit
        that's included, and "X" are bits that are not to be 
        included.  Its best to have eight characters, as that
        makes it clearer what's going on.  If the variable
        is a full byte, this attribute can be omitted.
    <LI><dfn>default</dfn> - The default value for this variable. This is
        used for a new decoder, or when you want to set the
        decoder back to its defaults.
    <LI><dfn>comment</dfn> - Use this for whatever you want.
    </UL>
(There are a few more, which we'll leave for the advanced section below)

<LI>
You can also define new variables. A good starting point is to copy a
similar definition, change its name to a new value, and then edit its
contents.
<P>
To define how the new variable is displayed and editted, you add elements within
the 'variable' element.  There are several possible forms:
<UL>
<LI>For a decimal value, you include a decVal element like the 
example above.  The two optional attributes are min and max, 
which define the range of acceptable values. If you
omit them, values from 0 to 255 are allowed.
<LI>If you'd rather enter and display values in hexadecimal, use a
'hexVal' element. Its otherwise the same as the
'decVal' element we've already discussed.
<LI>If your decoder supports a long address, you can add a 
'longAddress' element. Its perhaps easiest to copy
this from another file, or from this example:
<PRE>
    &lt;variable name=&quot;Long Address&quot; CV=&quot;17&quot;&gt;
        &lt;longAddressVal/&gt;
        &lt;/variable&gt;
</PRE>      
<LI>If your decoder supports it, you can enter
a 'speedTableVal' element for the speed table.  The only
attribute is "entries", which can be either "28", "14" or some
other value.  Example:
<PRE>
    &lt;variable name=&quot;Speed Table&quot; CV=&quot;67&quot;&gt;
        &lt;speedTableVal/&gt;
        &lt;/variable&gt;
</PRE>
<LI>Some decoder options are best represented by "choose one choice". These are 
represented by a enumVariable element. Example:
<PRE>
    &lt;variable name=&quot;F6 during DC operation&quot; CV=&quot;13&quot; mask=&quot;XXVXXXXX&quot;&gt;
        &lt;enumVal&gt;
            &lt;enumChoice choice=&quot;Off&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;enumChoice choice=&quot;On&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;/enumVal&gt;
        &lt;/variable&gt;
</PRE>
Each enumChoice element describes one possibility.  There can be 
as many of these as desired.  For a one bit choice, you use two 
enumChoice elements as in the
example.  For a 4 bit choice, like the FX codes in a Digitrax decoder, you
can use up to 16 choices.  They are displayed in the order they are entered
in the file, and are also numbered in that order.  If the first is chosen,
a 0 is entered in the CV bits; choosing the second stores 1; etc.
<P>
If you need to specific a specific number for an enum option, add
a "value" attribute:
<PRE>
            &lt;enumChoice choice=&quot;Blue&quot; value=&quot;32&quot;/&gt;
</PRE>

</UL>
<LI>
At this point, you've created a new configuration file!
<P>
You can check it for syntax by selecting the "Check XML file"
item from the "Tools" menu.  It opens a file selection dialog;
select your file and click "open". 
If all is well, you'll get a 
dialog box that says "OK".  If not, you'll get a completely
incomprehensible error message. About the only useful part of
that message is the line number; open an editor to that line
and try to see what's wrong with the syntax.
<LI>
All that's left is to enter your new file in the index.  This index
is used to speed the startup of the program, when the list of 
available decoders is constructed.
<P>
Select the "Create decoder index" item from the "Tools" menu.</ol>

</OL>
Congratulations!  You're done.  Next, open the 
programmer application and try it.

<a id="introXML"><h3>A very short introduction to XML files</h3></a>

All of the configuration files use the XML format. 
This section is a  
brief explanation of that format to make it a little easier to read.

<P>XML files are made up of "elements", which are delimited by "tags". 
It's a lot like HTML, if you're familiar with that.  A tag is enclosed
in angle brackets, for example <decoder>.  An element can either begin
and end with a tag:
<PRE>
    &lt;decoder&gt;
        other stuff here
    &lt;/decoder&gt;
</pre>
or have both the start and end tags combined:
<PRE>
    &lt;decoder/&gt;
</PRE>
Note the back-slash characters. They mark the end of the element.  The starting
tag of an element can also carry attributes:
<PRE>
    &lt;decoder name="foo"&gt;
        other stuff here
    &lt;/decoder&gt;
</PRE>
The example shows the attribute "name" being set to a value of "foo".
Some attributes are required, and some are optional.  Note the double-quotes
around the attribute value. They are required.
<P>
Finally, a word about line-breaks and indentation. 
Tabs, spaces and line-breaks don't mean anything in XML files
except within the double quotes of an attribute value.  
To make it easier
to read the original file, we often use the indenting to show what elements
are inside each other.  Each time we start a new element, we indent its
contents by another four spaces.  An example would be:
<PRE>
    &lt;decoder&gt;
        &lt;variable&gt;
            stuff in the 1st variable element
        &lt;/variable&gt;
        &lt;variable&gt;
            stuff in the 2nd variable element
        &lt;/variable&gt;
    &lt;/decoder&gt;
</PRE>
You can break the contents of an element across a line, if that
makes it easier to read:
<PRE>
    &lt;tagWithLotsOfAttributes  firstAttribute="foo" secondAttribute="bar"
            thirdAttribute="biff" fourthAttribute="bing" /&gt;
</PRE>

<a id="decoderDetails"><h3>More details of decoder configuration</h3></a>

<h4>Decoder families</h4>

There are a lot of decoder models being produced!  Within a 
manufacturer's product line, decoder models can vary due to
hardware or software changes.  For example, the same program
can be used with hardware that handles 2, 3 or 4 functions.

<P>
To reduce the number of decoder definition files needed,
we group decoders into 'families'.  The decoders in a 
family share the same variables, and are probably based on the
same software.
They can differ in the number of output
wires and/or functions they support.
<P>
For example, a decoder file might contain variables that
control functions F(f), F(r), and F1 through F8, and 
also output wires 1 through 10.  But a specific model
decoder might have only four output lines, and only
respond to functions F(f), F(r), F1 and F2.  Another
member of the family has all of the wires present, and
responds to all of the functions.
<P>
The decoder definitions in the decoderIndex.xml file
contain two attributes that describe each model within
the family:
<UL>
<LI><dfn>numOuts</dfn> - the number of output 
<u>wires</u>.  This includes
the wires that drive the forward and reverse headlights,
F(f) and F(r), plus any other function outputs.
<LI><dfn>numFns</dfn> - the number of 
<u>functions</u>.  This is the
highest numbered function on a cab that the decoder will respond
to. For example, if F4 is the highest, set numFns="4".
</UL>

Within each decoder definition file, two attributes
describe whether a variable is associated with a
specific function or output:
<UL>
<LI><dfn>minOut</dfn> - What is the <u>minimum</u> number of
outputs for this variable to be useful?  For example, 
a variable with minOut="4" would not be displayed for
a decoder model with numOuts="3", but would be 
displayed for one with numOuts="4" or higher.
<LI><dfn>minFn</dfn> - What function needs to be present for
this variable to be useful?  For example,
a variable with minFn="3" would be associated with 
F3, and would be only useful for a decoder
with numFns="3" or larger.  Note that F(f) 
and F(r) aren't counted in this; the number
really is the number labeling the function
on the throttle.
</UL>

<a id="naming"><h4>Variable names</h4></a>

Different manufacturers have different names for their decoder configuration 
variables. Sometimes this is due to the decoder having a unique capability, but
sometimes its just different terminology for the same old thing.  This 
presents a problem for a configurable programmer like Decoder Pro.  On
the one hand, the programmer definitions have use some common name to 
refer to things, so they can specify what variables go on each pane.
On the other hand, its important to be able to handle new and unique
decoder options.  We handle this by defining "standard names", providing
some controls, and using some conventions.  This section discusses those.

<P>
Panes in a programmer file are defined in terms of "standard names". 
You can see the complete list in the names.xml file. 
The "check programmer names" tool
(from the "Tools" menu) can be used to check that a programmer definition
file uses only valid names.

<P>
When the program
is setting up a new pane, it will seach the decoder definition for a 
variable with a matching name. 
If everybody could agree on the same names and the same decoder features,
this would be sufficient. But they can't, for good reasons.
To handle differing terminology, its possible for the decoder definition
to carry two names for a variable.  These are the "manufacturer's name", 
given by the "label" attribute, and the "standard name", in the "item"
attribute.  The programmer looks at both when trying to find a variable
to display.

<P>
Each pane can be configured to display either the standard names,
or the manufacturer's names.  Why would you want to do this, and 
how do you do it?
<UL>
<LI>You always want the pane to look the same, regardless of
what the manufacturer calls the variables.  To do this,
set the pane's "nameFmt" attribute to "item".
<LI>You want the pane to show the manufacturers terminology. This
is the default, so you don't have to do anything. To force it,
you can set the "nameFmt" attribute to "label".
</UL>

<P>
That second approach also allows us to handle features that 
vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.  For example, consider
"lighting effects" functions.  Different manufacturers call these
different things, and they do different things.  But if we want to 
have a "Lighting" pane in a programmer, we have to deal with these
variations.  We handle this by having generic "standard names" like:
<PRE>
    Function 1 effect generated
    Function 1 behaviour
    Function 1 options

    Function 2 effect generated
    Function 2 behaviour
    Function 2 options
</PRE>
etc.  The lighting pane is defined in terms of these.  The decoder
definition files then include definitions like:
<PRE>
    &lt;variable label="FX mode for function 1" CV="51" mask="XXXXVVVV"
                item="Function 1 effect generated" &gt;
        &lt;enumVal&gt;
            &lt;enumChoice choice="Normal function of lead"/&gt;
            &lt;enumChoice choice="Random flicker"/&gt;
            ...
            &lt;enumChoice choice="Reserved (0x0F)"/&gt;
            &lt;/enumVal&gt;
        &lt;/variable&gt;
</PRE>
This will appear on the pane with the correct "FX mode for function 1"
label, even though the programmer was defined in terms of a more generic
name.

<P>
There will be cases where neither of the previous approaches
work. For example, a decoder has the completely unique capability
of controlling how the locomotive smells.  There are no clear
standard names that could cover this.  In these cases, the
decoder file can include the definition of a specific
programmer pane, which will be presented to the user.  (But see
the section on defining a programmer for information on how to
control this)


<a id="fnMap"><h4>Function mapping</h4>
Some decoders provide a way of configuring which functions, i.e.
buttons on the cab, operate each output, i.e. the output wires that
are connected to lights. Generally, decoders which have this
capability use a large number of bits to control the mapping.
<P>
Decoder Pro provides a special programming element to 
make configuring these easier. Just insert the element
<PRE>
       &lt;fnmapping/&gt;
</PRE>
in the programmer definition XML file.  (This takes up
a bunch of screen space, so you might want to have it 
on a pane by iteself)
<P>
The function map creates a rectangular grid with function
names on the left and outputs across the top, then
looks in the decoder definition for
variables with names like "F1 controls output 1".
For each of these that it finds, it fills in 
the corresponding element on the grid with a checkbox.
If the default value for the variable is 1, the checkbox
will start with a check in it.
<P>
More formally, the map is looking for 
variables with a name of the form 
<PRE>
"(function) controls output (output)"
</PRE>
The function name can be one of "FL(f)", "FL(r)", and "F1" 
through "F12".
The output name can be from "1" to "14", plus whatever names
have been defined as 
<A HREF="sounds">extra outputs</a> (see next section).
<P>
Some decoders do not provide CVs for changing the function
mapping; without these CVs, nothing would be displayed in the 
function map.  To get around this and show a "constant" map, 
you can use a constant element like:
<PRE>
       &lt;constant label="F2 controls output 4" minOut="4" minFn="2" default="1" /&gt; 
</PRE>

<a id="sounds"><h4>Sound outputs</h4>
Sound-generating decoders use functions like F2
to control sounds instead of output wires.  We want to be able
to handle these properly in function mapping, etc.  It's much
more convenient to refer to these as "Bell", etc, rather than 
trying to remember that "Output 5" is really a specific sound rather
than an output wire.
<P>
To do this, include some extra elements in the decoder definition 
itself:
<PRE>
    &lt;family name="DSD Steam" mfg="Throttle-Up"
            lowVersionID="6" highVersionID="7"&gt;
        &lt;model model="DSD Steam" numOuts="4"&gt;
            &lt;output name="Whistle"/&gt;
            &lt;output name="Bell"/&gt; 
            &lt;output name="Hiss"/&gt; 
            &lt;output name="Dynamo"/&gt; 
            &lt;output name="Coupler"/&gt; 
            &lt;output name="Mute"/&gt; 
            &lt;/model&gt;
    &lt;/family&gt;
</PRE>
The output elements within the model tell Decoder Pro that,
in addition to the wires defined by numOuts, there are additional
sound outputs that should appear when mapping functions.
<P>
You can also use this capability to label the output wires of a decoder with 
their color, etc.

<a id="files"><h3>What the configuration files contain and where they are located</h3></a>

There are two places where configuration files can be found:
<UL>
<LI>The user's JMRI preferences directory and its subdirectories. This is searched
first for any needed files. You should put any locally-modified 
versions of files here so they don't get overwritten by a new version
of the program. Any files that the program writes to contain local
information, e.g. roster entries, are also written here.
<P>The location of this varies by computer type.  
<UL>
<LI>On a Linux machine,
look for a .jrmi directory in your home directory.  
<LI>On a Macintosh, 
look in the Preferences folder of the current System Folder if running
MacOS 8 or 9, or the Library/Preferences folder in your user directory on
MacOS X.  
<LI>On Windows, this can be in a number of places depending on which
Windows version you're running and whether you have multiple users configured;
Search for a "JMRI" directory to find it. 
</UL>Make sure you find the preferences,
not the original application package. They are kept separate to simplify 
updating the program version.  You'll know you've found the right place if
you see the preferences files that store your applications settings:  DecoderProConfig.xml,
JmriDemoConfig.xml and/or LocoToolsConfig.xml.  You can also search
for one of those files to find this directory

<LI>The originally-distributed versions of files
are contained in 'xml' directory in the application package
and its subdirectories.   Anything you modify
here will be lost when you update the program to a new version.
</UL>

Within these two locations, there are a number of types of
configuration files:
<UL>
<LI>Decoder definitions - Stored in the 'decoders' subdirectory,
these define how a specific family of decoders is configured.
<LI>Programmer definitions - Stored in the 'programmers' subdirectory,
these define the formats for the various programming sheets that 
are available in Decoder Pro.
<LI>Locomotive configurations - Stored in the 'roster' subdirectory,
these record the specific configuration of each locomotive in your roster.
</UL>
There are also a few general configuration files, which live in the 
top-level xml or prefs directory:
<UL>
<LI>roster.xml - an index of your locomotives
<LI>decoderIndex.xml - an index of the available decoder definition 
files. It also contains the information on which specific decoder
model uses which file, how to identify them, and what options they
implement.
<LI>names.xml - not used during normal operation, this is a list of
the standard variable names for use in programmer definitions.  
</UL>

<a id="programmer"><h3>Defining a new programmer format</h3></a>

<h4>Specifying the items to display</h4>

The basic element of a programmer pane is a "display". This tells
the programmer to present a single variable.  The attributes are:
<UL>
<LI><dfn>name</dfn> - (Required) This is the "standard name" of the variable
to be presented.  
<LI><dfn>label</dfn> - If present, this will be used to label the variable
on the pane instead of the name or standard name of the variable.
<LI><dfn>layout</dfn> - Where to locate the label with respect to the
edittable field, e.g. the text box.  Possible values are
"left", "above", "below", "right" with a default of "right".
<LI><dfn>format</dfn> - How the variable should be presented.
Numeric variables can be presented as 
<UL>
<LI>an editable text field, which is the default if nothing is specified
<LI><dfn>hslider</dfn> - a horizontal slider
<LI><dfn>vslider</dfn> - a vertical slider
</UL>
Enum variables can be presented as
<UL>
<LI>a selection box, which is the default if nothing is specified
<LI><dfn>radiobuttons</dfn> - Each possible value is presented as an individual button
<LI><dfn>checkbox</dfn> - An enum
with only two states can also be presented as a checkbox
<LI><dfn>offradiobutton</dfn> - A single button that sets the 0 choice for the 
variable when selected 
<LI><dfn>onradiobutton</dfn> - A single button that sets the 1 choice for the 
variable when selected 
</UL>
These last two can be useful for indicating
which parts of a configuration are active; see the "Speed Table"
pane of Comprehensive.xml for an example.
<LI><dfn>tooltip</dfn> - Allows you to specify a tooltip to be presented when
the cursor is left over the variable.  If not present, the tooltip
defined in the decoder file is used. (Note: This is not fully implemented
yet, but you should include them in your programmer definitions
as they will work soon)
</UL>

<P>
Which name to display is controlled by the pane's  'nameFmt'
attribute, and the 'label' attribute on each display element (variable).
The choices are:
<UL>
<LI>If a label is specified, it will be used.  Use a label if you
want absolute control over what a variable should be called, regardless
of what the decoder file calls it, and you don't like the standard name.
<LI>The pane's nameFmt attribute is "item", in which case the item
name will be used regardless of what the decoder file calls the variable.
Use this is you want a uniform appearance for the pane for all decoders.
But be aware that some standard names are really so generic as to be useless.
<LI>If the pane's nameFmt attribute is allowed to default, or contains "mfg",
the decoder definition file's name will be used.  This is the normal form,
as it allows a manufacturer to specify in some detail what a 
variable defines.
</UL>

<h4>Formatting</h4>
Each pane of the programmer consists of (nested) rows and/or columns.
Columns lay out variables from top to bottom.  Rows lay out
variables from left to right.  You can nest these to achieve
various effects; for an example of this, see the "Speed Table"
pane of the Comprehensive.xml file.  It has two columns, the left of each 
uses a row to put some sliders from left to right.

<h4>Special elements</h4>
There are a number of elements you can use to get the programmer
formatted exactly the way you want:
<UL>
<LI><dfn>label</dfn> - Add text to a pane.
<LI><dfn>separator</dfn> - Add a separator line to a pane.  If included 
in a column, this will be a horizontal separator line.  If
included in a row, it will be a vertical line.
<LI><dfn>cvtable</dfn> - Insert a table of CV values onto the pane.  
To get the spacing right, etc, you should probably not combine
this with other variables on the same pane.
<LI><dfn>fnmapping</dfn> - Show a function mapping grid. 
This requires variables with specific names, see below.
<LI><dfn>dccaddress</dfn> - Show a combined variable for the DCC address.  This 
consists of a checkbox that selects use of short vs long address, and
a single text field for entering the address.  Depending on how 
the checkbox is set, the text field will configure the CV1 short
address or the CV17/18 long address.
</UL>

<P>
All of the .xml files in the "programmers" subdirectory will 
appear in the selection box when you create a new programmer in 
Decoder Pro.  To use your new file, just put it in the 
"programmers" subdirectory of the "prefs" directory and
select it.  You don't have to restart the program, as the
list is remade each time you open a new programmer window.

<P>
There is an option to present/hide panes from the decoder file.  If you're
writing a very basic programmer, you might want to hide them.

<a id="roster"><h3>How the roster is stored; updating it by hand</h3></a>

The roster information presented in the selection box, and used for
automatic selection of a locomotive, is stored in the roster.xml file
in the "prefs" directory.  You can open this file and look
at it to see the format.  You should use the Roster menu to manipulate it
to ensure that it stays self-consistent.

<a id="loco"><h3>What's in a locomotive file?</h3></a>

(To be written)

<a id="debug"><h3>Debugging</h3></a>

<h4>While the program is running</h4>
While the program is running, 
debugging information is printed to "standard output", which is in different
places depending on what operating system you're using and how you started the
program.  On a Macintosh classic, it appears in a window that's created with the
first error message.  With MacOS X, it may appear in a new window, or you may
have to launch the "Console" application to see it.  On Windows, you may have
to run one the "Debug" batch files to see the error messages; look for them in the
application's directory.
<P>
Error logging is controlled by the "default.lcf" file.  It has lots of comments
on what the various terms mean.  If you'd like messages to be logged to a file, 
change the line
<PRE>
    log4j.rootCategory= WARN, A1
</PRE>
to include the additional logging destination "R":
<PRE>
    log4j.rootCategory= WARN, A1,R
</PRE>
R is defined later in default.lcf as logging to the "example.log" file.
You can also get a lot of additional information on what the program is 
doing by setting the log level to either INFO or DEBUG, e.g.
<PRE>
    log4j.rootCategory= INFO, A1
</PRE>
Note that the DEBUG level will output a lot of information, and will slow
down operation significantly.  Its also possible to request more information
on just parts of the program, but in order for that to be useful you 
have to have spent some time learning about the internals.

<h4>Debugging problems with XML files</h4>
When an XML file can't be parsed, you'll get some hard-to-understand
error messages. 
The most important part of this is the line number.  Use that to
start looking for the problem.
<P>
You might be able to get better debugging information by trying
to open the file with Internet Explorer.  The debugging information
it provides is generally more detailed than that provided by the 
XML routines in the JDOM libraries used by JMRI and Decoder Pro.
<P>Note that Explorer needs
to see both the .xml file, plus the definition information in the
.dtd file.  If you get a message like "error in system resource", you
need to put a copy of the associated .dtd file (e.g. decoder-config.dtd)
in the directory with your new file.  DTD's can be found in the dtd
subdirectory of the xml directory.
