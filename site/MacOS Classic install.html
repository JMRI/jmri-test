<h3><a id="Mac8">Macintosh MacOS 8 and 9 information:</a></h3>

We test these programs on a 90MHz Power Macintosh 7100 with 32MB of memory.  This is about
the minimum needed; it works, but is quite slow. Both a faster CPU and more
memory are recommended. 
A screen size of 800x600 or larger is strongly recommended.

<H3>To install</h3>
This application should run with any recent release of the Macintosh Runtime for Java (MRJ).  
MRJ requires Mac OS 8.1 or later.  
If you don't have Java installed on your Macintosh, or even if your're
not sure, download the installer from Apple at
  <a href="http://developer.apple.com/java/download.html">http://developer.apple.com/java/download.html</a>
and run it.
<P>
You need to have the Java Swing and Java communications libraries installed.
An installer can be downloaded from
  <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JavaLibsInstaller-2.hqx?download">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JavaLibsInstaller-2.hqx?download</a>.
Unfortunately, its a 4MB download.  You only have to do it once, however; 
future updates of DecoderPro will continue to use these same libraries.
<P>
Be sure to run both of these installers before installing DecoderPro.
<P>
Note that you will have to reinstall these if 
you have to reinstall the system software, or if you do a "clean install"
of an OS update.
<P>
Download the 1.3.8b version from 
<A HREF="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JMRI.1.3.8b.Classic.hqx?download">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jmri/JMRI.1.3.8b.Classic.hqx?download</a>
and unpack it. This will create a "JMRI" folder.
<P>
To install, you just have to move the JMRI folder to where you want it 
on your computer.

<P>The 1.3.8b version is our most recent version.
The project is continuously adding features, however, and
new "test" versions appear every couple of weeks.  You may find
one of these has features that you really want.  
These are announced in the "jmriusers"
Yahoo discussion group at
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/</A>.
To download one of these, please see the
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=26788&package_id=49077">test version download page</a>.

<P>
Once those packages are installed, you can
run the program by double-clicking on the 
<A HREF="DecoderPro/index.html">"DecoderPro"</A>,
<A HREF="LocoTools.html">"LocoTools"</A>, 
<A HREF="PanelPro.html">"PanelPro"</A>
or 
<A HREF="index.html">"JmriDemo"</A>
application icons
in the JMRI folder.
