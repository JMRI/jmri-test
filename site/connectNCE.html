<h2>Connecting to an NCE DCC system</h2>

To connect your computer to an NCE system, you 
can usually just connect the 
command station to the computer's serial
port using a 9-pin serial cable.
<P>
Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program.  This opens 
automatically the first time a program is run, or you can select it from
the "Edit" menu.  
<P>
Select "NCE" from the top selection box. You can then
select the proper serial port in the second selection box.  
<P>
The baud
rate selection box will be fixed at 9600 baud.
<P>
The series of radio buttons labelled "GUI style" allows you to select
how the program will look.  
"Metal" is the native Java look available on all types. 
Other choices will vary with your computer type. "Motif", "Windows", "MacOS" 
and "MacOS Adaptive" look native on Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic" and MacOS X
respectively.
<P>
In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default programmer format. You can
override this each time you open the programmer, so this is here just for convenience.
<P>
Click "Save".  You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to quit, click "Yes".
<P>
Restart the program. You should be up and running.

<P>
Note: Some NCE command stations
have an "optional analog control circuit".  In these, pins 5, 6, and 9
are used with an analog voltage as a separate throttle.  If you have one
of these command stations, <I>a normal 9-pin serial cable will not work!</I>
You'll need to make a custom cable that just connects the "send data", "receive data"
and "ground" pins.  See your NCE manual for details.
