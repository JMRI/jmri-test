Test version 1.3.0 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.Note:This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go back to an earlier version.Warnings:If you haven't downloaded and run a 1.2.something version, thisversion will require that you re-enter your preferences.  You mightwant to open the preferences window (from the Edit menu) and writedown your settings before installing this version.  (You'll be ableto go back to the older version if you need to)If you have pre-1.2.3 roster entries that use Zimo decoder definitions, you'llhave to recreate them.  The Zimo decoder definitions have beencompletely reworked in a better organization starting with testversion 1.2.3.Download links:Please use these links for downloading, including the "?download" atthe end.
