<H2>Installing Java on Macintosh Classic</H2>
Macintosh users should get Java version MRJ 2.4, which corresponds to Java 1.1.8,
from Apple at <A HREF="http://devworld.apple.com/java/text/download.html">

<H2>Installing Java on MacOS X</H2>
MacOS X comes with a working Java, which can be operated much like the
Linux form. It shouldn't be necessary to install anything.

<H2>Installing Java on Linux</H2>
Start by making sure you have an appropriate version of Java on your system,
a version number of 1.1.5 or greater.
You can check the version number by typing
<PRE>
   java -version
</PRE>
<P>
If you did not install Java on your system yourself, be aware that some systems
have Java only partially installed.  They will respond correctly to the above
command, but still are not all there.
If your system does not have Java in the environment variable PATH,
the install is probably not complete.
Check with the system manager or do a fresh Java installation.
<P>
You can obtain a Linux version of Java free from
Sun at <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se">
http://java.sun.com/j2se</A>
<P>
The same page contains links to third party versions of Java for other platforms.
<P>
<P>
If you are using Java 1.1,
<A NAME="classpath">Set the environment variable CLASSPATH</A>
as follows (being sure to use all capitals).
<BR>
The exact setting of CLASSPATH depends on where you placed the Java code,
but it should start with "." to include the current directory, and it should then
specify where the basic Java classes are to be found.
Examples are:

<P>setenv CLASSPATH ".:/usr/lib/jdk1.1/lib/classes.zip"


<H2>Installing Java on Windows</H2>
Start by making sure you have an appropriate version of Java on your system,
a version number of 1.1.5 or greater.
You can check the version number by typing
<PRE>
   java -version
</PRE>
<P>

have Java only partially installed.  They will respond correctly to the above
command, but still are not all there.

The exact setting of CLASSPATH depends on where you placed the Java code,
but it should start with "." to include the current directory, and it should then

Examples are:
<P>set CLASSPATH=.;C:\jdk1.1.8\lib\classes.zip;
<UL>
<LI><A NAME="setntenv">NT users</A>
who have administrative privileges on their machines can make
this CLASSPATH setting permanent by going to the
<UL>
<LI>
Start Menu...Settings...Control Panel...System...Environment
<LI>
Add a new Variable, "CLASSPATH" (careful, make it all Caps)
<LI>
Set the value as indicated above
<LI>
Then be sure to BOTH hit the Apply button and then the OK button.
<LI>
All new command windows will then have these settings
(old ones will not get the new settings).
<LI>
To review the current settings in any command window, just type "set"
<LI>
In some cases, the new settings do not take effect until after a reboot.
</UL>
<LI>Windows 9x users can make the CLASSPATH setting permanent by
doing the CLASSPATH equivalent of the procedure for making PATH changes
permanent that you will find at
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/install-windows.html#Environment">http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/install-windows.html#Environment</A>
<LI>Windows 9x users should also:
<BR>set OS=W98 (or 95, etc)
<BR>increase environment space as explained at:
