<H1>Installing Java on various plaforms</h1>
This page discusses how to install Java on various platforms.  
Please note that you might not need to do this! Many computers now
come with Java installed, or have it installed during the normal 
software update process.

<H2>Installing Java on Macintosh Classic</H2>
Macintosh users should get the most recent
version of the Java MRJ (Macintosh Runtime for Java), which corresponds to Java 1.1.8,
from Apple at <A HREF="http://devworld.apple.com/java/text/download.html">
http://devworld.apple.com/java/text/download.html</A>

<H2>Installing Java on MacOS X</H2>
MacOS X comes with a working Java, which can be operated much like the
Linux form. It shouldn't be necessary to install anything, but you should 
allow software update to apply patches as they become available.

<H2>Installing Java on Windows</H2>
Start by making sure you have an appropriate version of Java on your system,
a version number of 1.3.1 or greater.
You can check the version number by typing
<PRE>
   java -version
</PRE>
<P>
You can obtain the Windows version of Java free from
Sun at <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/getjava">
http://java.sun.com/getjava</A>
We generally develop using the currently most widely-used Java version,
which is now the
"1.3.1-1" version of the "Java Runtime Environment".
Sun says it has
been installed on over 25 million machines.  
<P>
Sun offers both an "online" and an "offline" installer for
the Java Runtime Engine (JRE). The online installer is about
1.3MB, but needs an Internet connection to complete the install.
The offine installer is about 14.5MB, but includes everything.
<P>
As the size of software you can download from the Internet has
increased, distributors have looked for ways to decrease the time
it takes to do this. Since a software package may include features
a user doen't need or want, one way to decrease the time is to
make the installation "live". You initially download a small program,
which is an Internet installer. When you run the program you are asked
what components of the package you want to install. Only those
components are downloaded and installed.
<P>
Hers's what Sun has to say about this:
<UL>
<LI>Windows Installation
<P>
Saves download time if installing only some of the features. This 
install first downloads and runs a small program that prompts the user 
for options to download and install. The user must be connected to the 
Internet in order to complete this installation. Includes support for 
additional languages, fonts and media. This choice downloads and 
installs Microsoft Windows Installer 2.0 if not already installed. If 
you are behind an authenticated proxy server, you must use the Windows 
Offline Installer instead. Before making this choice, turn off any 
download managers, other than the Sun Download Manager, if you are using it.

<LI>Windows Offline Installation
<P>This downloaded file includes everything required to perform a complete 
installation. It can be copied to a machine that is disconnected from 
the network and executed to perform a complete or custom install. 
Includes Microsoft Windows Installer 2.0 and support for additional 
languages, fonts and media. Use this installer if the normal Windows 
Installer does not work.
</UL>

<H2>Installing Java on Linux</H2>
Start by making sure you have an appropriate version of Java on your system,
a version number of 1.3.1 or greater.
You can check the version number by typing
<PRE>
   java -version
</PRE>
<P>
If you did not install Java on your system yourself, be aware that some systems
have Java only partially installed.  They will respond correctly to the above
command, but still are not all there.
If your system does not have Java in the environment variable PATH,
the install is probably not complete.
Check with the system manager or do a fresh Java installation.
<P>
You can obtain a Linux version of Java free from
Sun at <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/getjava">

The same page contains links to third party versions of Java for other platforms.
