<H1>Installing Java on various plaforms</h1>
This page discusses how to install Java on various platforms.  
Please note that you might not need to do this! Many computers now
come with Java installed, or have it installed during the normal 
software update process.

<H2>Installing Java on Macintosh Classic</H2>
Macintosh users should get the most recent
version of the Java MRJ (Macintosh Runtime for Java), which corresponds to Java 1.1.8,
from Apple at <A HREF="http://devworld.apple.com/java/text/download.html">

<H2>Installing Java on MacOS X</H2>
MacOS X comes with a working Java, which can be operated much like the
Linux form. It shouldn't be necessary to install anything, but you should 
allow software update to apply patches as they become available.

<H2>Installing Java on Windows</H2>
Start by making sure you have an appropriate version of Java on your system,
a version number of 1.2 or greater.
You can check the version number by typing
<PRE>
   java -version
</PRE>
<P>
You can obtain the Windows version of Java free from
Sun at <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se">

We generally use the "1.3.1-1" version of the "Java Runtime Environment".
This is currently most widely-used Java version.  Sun says its
been installed on over 25 million machines.  The installer
is a 5MB download, and can be gotten from 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre/</a>.


<H2>Installing Java on Linux</H2>
Start by making sure you have an appropriate version of Java on your system,
a version number of 1.2 or greater.
You can check the version number by typing
<PRE>
   java -version
</PRE>
<P>
If you did not install Java on your system yourself, be aware that some systems
have Java only partially installed.  They will respond correctly to the above
command, but still are not all there.
If your system does not have Java in the environment variable PATH,
the install is probably not complete.
Check with the system manager or do a fresh Java installation.
<P>
You can obtain a Linux version of Java free from
Sun at <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se">

<P>
The same page contains links to third party versions of Java for other platforms.
