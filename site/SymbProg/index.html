<H2>JMRI: Symbolic Programmer</h2>

Modern DCC decoders are complicated beasts to program.  
The simple idea of "put the address in CV01" doesn't cope well when you 
program complicated functions using combinations of bit patterns.  A friendlier
interface is needed.  There are programs that provide better ways of programming 
specific decoders.  Unfortunately, they are limited to specific types of computers, and
only their authors can customize them for new types of decoders.
<P>
The JMRI symbolic programmer is meant to improve this. It is configured 
using text files, so that it can be adapted to additional decoder types easily.
It talks to the decoders using the JMRI programming interface, so that it can
run on any computer and layout hardware that JMRI has been ported to.  And since
the code is available via open source, if you want to improve on it you can.
<h3>What does it look like?</h3>

<h3>How to use it</h3>
Currently (August 16, 2001) the programmer is still being developed.  In part, this page
exists to encourage people to suggest how it can be improved.  Please send any comments 
to <A HREF="mailto:jake@physics.berkeley.edu">Bob Jacobsen</A>, or post them
via the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmri/">JMRI project site</a> as a feature request  
(An anonymous feature 
request started this whole effort! We take them very seriously)
<P>
If you want to use it as it stands, you're welcome to take a snapshot from our CVS repository.
See the <A HREF="http://jmri.sourceforge.net/">main JMRI page</a> for info on how to do that.
<P>
If you'd prefer to just get a downloadable version to try out, please be patient.  We expect to do that
around August 23rd, 2001.  When available, it will be announced on the 
<A HREF="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-announce">JMRI announcements mailing list</A>, and this page will be updated.
