<H2>How to Create an XPressNet Log File</H2>
 Start Decoder Pro (or the JMRI demo)
 Open the XpressNet Monitor (this is in the XPressNet submenu of the 
 "Systems" menu)
 
 Next Click the "Choose log file" button, and choose a log file to use
 (you can use the default name, the important thing is to know where the
 file is)
 
 After you click save in the dialog box, click the "Start Logging" button
 on the monitor.
 
 Now you can perform whatever actions you want to perform
 (try to throw a few turnouts in your case).
 
 Finally, go back to the XPressNet Monitor window, and click the "Stop
 Logging" button.
 
 You can now quit the application, or continue working.
