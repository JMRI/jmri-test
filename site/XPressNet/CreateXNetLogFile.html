<H2>How to Create an XPressNet Log File</H2>
 Start Decoder Pro (or the JMRI demo)
 Open the XpressNet Monitor (this is in the XPressNet submenu of the 
 "Systems" menu)
<br> 
 Next Click the "Choose log file" button, and choose a log file to use
 (you can use the default name, the important thing is to know where the
 file is)
 <Br>
 After you click save in the dialog box, click the "Start Logging" button
 on the monitor.
 <Br> 
 Now you can perform whatever actions you want to perform.
  <Br>
 Finally, go back to the XPressNet Monitor window, and click the "Stop
 Logging" button.

 You can now quit the application, or continue working.
