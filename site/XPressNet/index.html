<h2>XPressNet Overview</h2>
<p>
   XPressNet is the Command Bus used by <a 
href="http://www.atlasrr.com">Atlas</a>,<a 
href="http://www.lenz.com">Lenz</a>,<a 
href="http://www.ztccontrols.com">ZTC Controls</a>, and <a 
href="http://www.roco.co.at">Roco</a>. It was developed by 
Lenz.  The XPressNet specification (available from the Lenz website) 
specifies the electrical communications standards and command set 
needed for devices to communicate with the command station.  While the command 
stations support the same commands over the XPressNet connection, they do 
not all use the same connectors.  It may be necessary to build an adapter 
to plug a device into a command station from another manufacturer.
</p> 
<p>
   JMRI supports the current version (XBus/XPressNet Version 3.0).  We may 
add XBus Version 1.0 and 2.0 support in the future which will allow all XBus 
based systems to work with JMRI.

<h2>Computer Interfaces</h2>
<p>
   There are Three computer interfaces that JMRI has been tested with, and 
developed for.
</p>
<p>
   The Lenz LI100 is Lenz's original computer interface.  It is limited to 
a serial port speed of 9600 baud
</p>
<p>
   The Lenz LI100F is an improved version of the LI100.  It 
supports serial port speeds of 9600 and 19,200 baud.  The Factory default 
is 9600 baud.
</p>
<p>
   The Lenz LI101 is Lenz's latest computer interface.  It is 
significantly different than the LI100 and LI100F in physical apearance, 
and in the method by which the device is configured.  The device is 
configured via a softwaretool provided by Lenz which runs on Windows only.  
We have included a configuration tool with JMRI that will allow users of 
other operating systems to configure thier LI101 as well.  The LI101 
supports serial port speeds of 19,200, 38,400, 57,600, and 115,200 baud.  
The factory default is 19,200 baud</p>

<h2>XPressNet Command Stations</h2>
<p>
   The following command stations support the full range of functions 
provided by JMRI: Lenz LZV100 and Lenz LZ100
</p>
<p>
   The following command stations provide support only for operating 
equipment on a layout (running trains and throwing switches): Atlas 
Commander and Lenz Compact.
</p>
<p>
   The following command stations have not been tested for compatability, 
but should be at least partially supported:Lenz LH200,Roco LocoMaus 2 
(Roco Part number 10760), ZTC 
Controls ZTC511 (with XPressNet V3.0 software),ZTC Controls ZTC521 (with XPressNet 
V3.0 software),

<h2>XPressNet Specific Tools</h2>
<p>
The following XPressNet Specific Tools are provided as part of the JMRI 
package (click on the name for mor information)
</p>
<a href=LZV100Configurationtool.html>LZV100 Configuration Tool</a> - This 
is a tool to configure the LZV100 command and power station via 
software</p>
<a href=LI101Configurationtool.html>LI101 Configuration Tool</a> - This 
tool configures the LI101 computer interface via software</p>
<a href=XNetSystemInformationtool.html>XPressnet System Information</a> - 
This tool obtains the software version and type of the command station and 
the Software version of the LI100/LI100F/LI101F connected to the 
computer.</p>
