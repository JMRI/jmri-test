<h1>JMRI PacketScript</h1>

This page discusses using the JMRI libraries to test decoders for NMRA
conformance, using a JMRI application called PacketScript.
This capability is being actively developed, and this 
page will not always be up-to-date.
<P>
See also the 
<A HREF="../Technical/index.html">base page for technical documentation</a>.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<A HREF="http://www.python.org">Python<a/> is a widely used scripting language that's
available on many types of computers.  A Java-based varient, called
<A HREF="http://www.python.org">Jython</a>,
has been integrated with JMRI to make it easy to control a model railroad
from the command line of a computer.

For example, you can run the JmriDemo application with a
Jython command line, which is then available for manipulating
objects like turnouts and sensors:

<PRE>
% ./jmrithon
execFileJython 2.1 on java1.4.1_01 (JIT: null)
(Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

>>> execfile("JmriDemo.py")
     0 JmriDemo.JMRIdemo                     INFO  - program starts [main]
 11109 JmriDemo.JMRIdemo                     INFO  - main initialization done [main]

>>> turnouts.newTurnout("LT1", "")
jmri.jmrix.loconet.LnTurnout@1a8f49

>>> turnouts.getTurnout("LT1").getCommandedState()
1

>>> lt1 = turnouts.getTurnout("LT1")

>>> lt1.setCommandedState(CLOSED)

>>> lt1.commandedState
2

>>> lt1.commandedState = THROWN

>>> lt1.commandedState
4

>>> 
</PRE>

<BR/>This also shows some of the simplifications that
Jython and the Python language brings to using JMRI code.  The
Java member function:
<PRE>
	turnout.SetCommandedState(jmri.Turnout.CLOSED);
</PRE>
can also be expressed in Jython as:
<PRE>
	turnout.commandedState = CLOSED
</PRE>
<BR/>
This results in much easier-to-read code.
<P>
For more information on the Jython language and it's 
relations with Java, the best reference is the
book published by O"Reilly.

<H2>Setup</H2>

Jython support is not (yet) standard in JMRI.  To use this:
<OL>
<LI>You must first have a working JMRI installation.  In particular, 
start the JmriDemo application and configure it to connect to your DCC
hardware, then save, quit and restart the program.  Make sure that the
connection is working for the menu-based tools before trying to use Jython.
<LI>Download and install Jython from
<A HREF="http://www.jython.org">http://www.jython.org</a>.  
Development is using the 2.1 version, so you
might want to start with that.  On MacOS X, the installer does not run, so you
have to manually invoke the jython_21.class file; the the MacOS X note
on the jython web site.  Make sure the installation is complete
by invoking jython from the command line:
<PRE>
   % jython
   Jython 2.1 on java1.4.1_01 (JIT: null)
   Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>> ^D
</PRE>
<LI>
Now you just have to have the required classes in the CLASSPATH
used when jython starts up.  The required list in Unix syntax is:
<PRE>
  setenv CLASSPATH .:jmri.jar:lib/log4j.jar:lib/collections.jar:lib/crimson.jar:lib/jdom-jdk11.jar
</PRE>
<BR/>
To save typing, the "jmrithon" script is available for use on Linux
and MacOS X systems:
<PRE>
  % ./jmrithon
  Jython 2.1 on java1.4.1_01 (JIT: null)
  Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> ^D
</PRE>
<BR/>The first time you run this, you'll get a number of messages
about "processing modified jar"; these can be ignored, as they are normal.
</OL>

<H2>Using Jython</h2>

This section of the page is a pile of useful information on
controlling Jython from JMRI.  

<h3>Initialization</h3>

JMRI uses the LogJ system extensively for logging information
during program execution.  To configure that when running with
Jython, you should do:
<PRE>
  import org
  org.apache.log4j.PropertyConfigurator.configure("default.lcf")
</PRE>
before starting any of the JMRI classes.  The "default.lcf"
is the name of the logging control file to be used; it can
be omitted.
<P>
To make JMRI classes available, you have to do:
<PRE>
  import java.io
</PRE>
As currently set up, this does not run any initialization
code.  You should therefore follow it with
<PRE>
  import java.io
  configfile = java.io.File(jmri.jmrit.XmlFile.prefsDir()+"JmriDemoConfig2.xml")
  jmri.InstanceManager.setConfigureManager(jmri.configurexml.ConfigXmlManager())
  jmri.InstanceManager.configureManagerInstance().load(configfile)
</PRE>
to activate the JMRI classes and connect to your layout 
hardware. "JmriDemoConfig2.xml" is the name of the configuration
file from the JmriDemo program; you can use another name if desired.
The configuration file controls the layout connection, and any other
options that may have been set when it was created.

<P>
Alternately, if you want to run the complete JmriDemo application,
including the menu bar, spash screen, etc, you can do:
<PRE>
 import apps
 apps.JmriDemo.JMRIdemo.main([]) 
</PRE>

<P>
To simplify this startup even further, you can do:
<PRE>
 execfile("JmriDemo.py")
</PRE>
to invoke these commands. 

<h3>Simplified access</h3>

JMRI uses the factory-pattern extensively to get access to 
objects.  In Java this results in verbose code like
<PRE>
   Turnout t2 = InstanceManager.turnoutManagerInstance().newTurnout("LT2", "turnout 2");
   t2.SetCommandedState(Turnout.THROWN)
</PRE>
Jython simplifies that by allowing us to provide useful variables,
and by shortening certain method calls.
<P>
To get access to the SignalHead, Sensor and Turnout managers, 
several shortcut variables are defined in the .py scripts listed above:
<UL>
<LI>sensors
<LI>signals
<LI>turnouts
</UL>
These can then be referenced directly in Jython as
<PRE>
   t2 = turnouts.newTurnout("LT2", "turnout 2");
</PRE>
Note that the variable t2 did not need to be declared.
Juthon provides a shortcut for parameters that have 
been defined with Java-Bean-like get and set methods:

<PRE>
   t2.SetCommandedState(Turnout.THROWN)
</PRE>
can be written as
<PRE>
   t2.commandedState = THROWN
</PRE>
where the assignment is actually invoking the set method.
Also note that THROWN was defined when running the Python script
at startup.

<H2>Using Python for signal logic and automation</h2>

The existing JMRI 
"<A HREF="../Automat.html">Automat</a>"
classes provide hooks for user layout automation, including signalling.
But they require that you write Java code and compile it into .class files.
<P>
The 
<A HREF="doc/jmri/jmrit/automat/JythonAutomaton.html">JythonAutomaton</a>
class is intended to make it easier to code custom layout automation, as
it will allow you to invoke a Jython script.  Once it's integrated into
the configuration process, you'll be able to code your automation in one
or more .py files, and have the program start running them at startup.

<h2>Next steps</h2>
We're just learning how to best to integrate JMRI and Python, so there
are still some basic mysteries.
<h3>Initialization and modules</h3>
The idea of Python "modules" isn't yet 
clearly understood.  There are three ways to start the program via 
a .py file:
<OL>
<LI>
<PRE>
  % ./jmrithon
  Jython 2.1 on java1.4.1_01 (JIT: null)
  Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> import JmriDemo
</PRE>
This works, in the sense that the program starts up. But the
convenience methods are all in the JmriDemo namespace:
<PRE>
  >>> turnouts.newTurnout("LT1","")
  Traceback (innermost last):
    File "<console>", line 1, in ?
  NameError: turnouts

  >>> JmriDemo.turnouts.newTurnout("LT1","")
  jmri.jmrix.loconet.LnTurnout@36b91b
</PRE>
which makes for significantly more work later.
<LI>
<PRE>
  % ./jmrithon
  >>>  execfile("JmriDemo.py")
</PRE>
This looks somewhat ugly, as it's not using the normal Python
modules techinque.  But it works!  The convenience methods are
in the top-level name space:
<PRE>
  turnouts.newTurnout("LT1", "")
</PRE>
<LI>
<PRE>
  % ./jmrithon JmriDemo.py
</PRE>
is convenient, as it's on one line that could be put in a script.
And it works, in the sense that the program starts up.  But 
it never issues a command prompt.
</OL>
We need to understand how the developers of Jython intended this
to be done.

<h3>Termination</h3>
Once the JMRI main thread (or Swing GUI thread?) has started, 
^D is not sufficient to exist the program.  You have to select
"Quit" from the actual file menu, or ^C the program.
<P>
It would be good to understand what's preventing the program 
from stopping when it gets the ^D.
