<h2>JMRI LocoNet tools</h2>

The 
<A HREF="index.html">JMRI libraries</a>
contain a number of LocoNet tools.  This page introduces
them, describes how to use them, and points you to installation and
other information.
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#locomon"><dfn>LocoNet monitor</dfn></a> - Display and log
the traffic on the LocoNet, in either hex or human readable form.
<LI><A HREF="#slotmon"><dfn>Slot monitor</dfn></a> - Watch the contents
of the command station's slots as they're changed.
<LI><A HREF="#sendpkt"><dfn>Packet source</dfn></a> - A tool to let you type 
and send packets to the LocoNet
<LI><A HREF="#pm4"><dfn>PM4 programmer</dfn></a> - A tool to let help
you configure PM4 boards.
<LI><A HREF="#bdl16"><dfn>BDL16 programmer</dfn></a> - A tool to let help
you configure BDL16 and BDL162 boards.
<LI><A HREF="#locoIO"><dfn>LocoIO programmer</dfn></a> - A tool to let help
you configure a LocoIO board.
</UL>
The libraries also contain utilities for controlling your layout (operating
turnouts and signals, responding to inputs and block occupancy, etc), for 
programming decoders, and others.  These are not LocoNet specific, so
are described in the 
<A HREF="../index.html">main JMRI pages</a>.

<A id="locomon"><h3>LocoNet monitor</h3></a>
<IMG SRC="images/LocoMonFrame.gif" ALT="Screen shot of LocoNet monitor" WIDTH="804" HEIGHT="320" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0"><P>
The LocoNet Monitor tool displays LocoNet traffic in a human-readable form.
The last 20 messages are available in a scrolling window.  Optionally, 
you can include the time the message was received, and/or the raw
packet bytes.  The log information can also be stored in a text file.

<A id="slotmon"><h3>Command station slot monitor</h3></a>
<IMG SRC="images/SlotMon.gif" ALT="Screen shot of slot monitor" WIDTH="630" HEIGHT="297" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0"><P>
The Slot Monitor tool displays a table of the "command station
slots'" contents.  Slots are used to control individual locomotives and
consists. The display includes the decoder's speed step format, current speed
and function settings, consist information and status. You can choose to show
either all slots or just the ones being actively used.

<A id="sendpkt"><h3>Sending packets</h3></a>
<IMG SRC="images/SendPkt.gif" ALT="Screen shot of packet tool" WIDTH="347" HEIGHT="103" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0"><P>
The Send Packet tool lets you type in a LocoNet packet and send it to the layout.
You type the packet in hexadecimal as pairs of characters, in the same
way its displayed in the LocoNet monitor.

<h3>Programming <A id="pm4">PM4</a> and <A id="bdl16">BDL16</a> boards</h3>
The PM4 programmer and BLDL16 programmer tools provide a simple graphic interface for
configuring Digitrax power and block-occupancy boards.  Each "option switch" is
shown as a checkbox on the screen.  You can read the current contents from the
board, and write your changes back easily.  There is no need to remove the board
from the layout, or climb underneath the layout to push buttons,
as all programming is done via their LocoNet connection.

<A id="locoio"><h3>Programming LocoIO boards</h3></a>
<IMG SRC="images/locoio.gif" ALT="Screen shot of LocoIO programmer" WIDTH="637" HEIGHT="326" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0"><P>
The LocoIO programmer provides a simple interface for configuring
<A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/loconet_hackers/files/LocoIO/">John Jabour's LocoIO board</a>, a powerful component for
building CTC boards and control panels. (More information on the
board is available at
<A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/loconet_hackers/files/LocoIO/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/loconet_hackers/files/LocoIO/</a>)
A more detailed description of the programmer is available on
<A HREF="Digitrax/locoIOprog.html">a separate page</a>.

<h2>Getting these tools</h2>

A complete version of these tools is available for download.  It will work on 
Macintosh, Windows, Linux and OS/2 computers.  The JMRI libraries
will work with NCE, EasyDCC, Atlas, Wangrow, Lenz and Digitrax
command stations, but of course the LocoNet
tools only work with a Digitrax LocoNet.
Note that JMRI is free software, and there is no "pay" version!
<P>
For more information on
how to install the demo, whether it will run on your computer, etc, please see the 
<A HREF="README.html">README file</A>.
<P>
JMRI is an open-source project, so you can get the entire source code at any time
via the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmri/">Project page</A>. For more
information, please see the
<A HREF="index.html">main JMRI page<a/>.

<h2>Running the tools</h2>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="README.html">Download and install</a> the JMRI demo program.
<LI>Start the program. On a Windows system, the "Start" menu will have a JMRI group, which
 contains an entry for the LocoTools program.  On other systems, start the program from
 the LocoTools icon or file.
<LI>From the preferences window, select either "MS100" or "LocoBuffer", depending on 
how your layout is connected.  Then select the serial port, and your command
station type.  If you're using a LocoBuffer, you should also select the 
baud rate corresponding to the LocoBuffer's jumper settings.  
Click "save".  You'll be prompted to quit and restart the program.
<li>After restarting the program, select a tool from the "LocoNet" menu.
