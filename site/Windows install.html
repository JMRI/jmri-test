<body>

<P>
<h3><a id="Windows">Windows installation instructions:</a></h3>

We recommend you have at least 40MB of 
memory for Windows 95 or 98, and 48MB of memory for Windows 2000 or later.
For the more complicated 
programmer screens, a display with a resolution of 800x600 or larger is
strongly recommended.
<P>
You need to have Java 1.3.1 or later installed on your machine. 
We test with JRE 1.3.1-01 and recommend you 
use it or a later version. 
If you don't yet have Java installed, "j2re-1_3_1_01-win.exe" file contains the 
installer.  You must run the Java installer (or have previously done so) 
before running the JMRI installer in the next step, or it will 
issue an error message and stop.
You can also get installers from Sun at
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/getjava/">http://java.sun.com/getjava/</a>.
<P>
Run the JMRI installer, which is the "JMRI.1.0.exe" file
on the CD.  It will ask you to read some licensing information, and
then install the needed libraries, plus add a "JMRI" program group to 
your Start menu and put a shortcut to the DecoderPro program on your
desktop.
<P>
Installation is complete.
You can start the programs from the JMRI group under Programs in your
Start menu.
