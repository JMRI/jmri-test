/**
 * Basic interface for access to named, managed objects.
 * <P>
 * {@link NamedBean} objects represent various real elements, and
 * have a "system name" and perhaps "user name".  A specific Manager
 * object provides access to them by name, and serves as a factory for
 * new objects.
 * <P>
 * Right now, this interface just contains the members needed
 * by {@link InstanceManager} to handle
 * managers for more than one system.
 * <P>
 * Although they are not defined here because their return type differs, any
 * specific Manager subclass
 * provides "get" methods to locate specific objects, and a "new" method
 * to create a new one via the Factory pattern.
 * The "get" methods will
 * return an existing object or null, and will never create a new object.
 * The "new" method will log a warning if an object already exists with
 * that system name.
 * <P>
 * add/remove PropertyChangeListener methods are provided. At a minimum,
 * subclasses must notify of changes to the list of available NamedBeans;
 * they may have other properties that will also notify.
