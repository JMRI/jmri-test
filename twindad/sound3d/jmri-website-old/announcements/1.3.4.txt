Test version 1.3.4 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.Note:This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any newor old bugs!  And please back up your JMRI files before installingthis, in case you want to go back to an earlier version.There was no test versions 1.3.1, 1.3.2 or 1.3.3; the most recent before this was 1.3.0.  Those numbers were skipped to avoid confusion with the Java version numbers.Warnings:LocoNet sensor numbering has been changed starting in this version! This will effect people who have panel files (.xml files containing panel definition) for LocoNet block occupancy sensors.  The sensor numbers now start with 0, not 1, so you'll have to edit the panel files to change e.g. LS0 to LS1, LS23 to LS24, etc.  This does not effect input via other (non-LocoNet) protocols, including C/MRI, NCE AIU, etc.  If you use LocoNet sensor numbers for the Speedometer, you'll have to increase them by one also.There seems to be a problem with recent JMRI versions on Macintosh Classic.  The cause of this is not understood.  For some people it works fine, and for others it locks up totally.  This version is not expected to improve that situation. If you encounter this problem, our only suggestion is to reinstall version 1.1.If you haven't downloaded and run a 1.2.something version, thisversion will require that you re-enter your preferences.  You mightwant to open the preferences window (from the Edit menu) and writedown your settings before installing this version.  (You'll be ableto go back to the older version if you need to)If you have pre-1.2.3 roster entries that use Zimo decoder definitions, you'llhave to recreate them.  The Zimo decoder definitions have beencompletely reworked in a better organization starting with testversion 1.2.3.Download links:Please use these links for downloading, including the "?download" atthe end.
