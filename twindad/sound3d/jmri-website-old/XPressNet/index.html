<h2>XPressNet Overview</h2>
<p>
   XPressNet is the Command Bus used by <a 
href="http://www.atlasrr.com">Atlas</a>,<a 
href="http://www.lenz.com">Lenz</a>,<a 
href="http://www.ztccontrols.com">ZTC Controls</a>, and <a 
href="http://www.roco.co.at">Roco</a>. It was developed by 
Lenz.  The XPressNet specification (available from the Lenz website) 
specifies the electrical communications standards and command set 
needed for devices to communicate with the command station.  While the command 
stations support the same commands over the XPressNet connection, they do 
not all use the same connectors.  It may be necessary to build an adapter 
to plug a device into a command station from another manufacturer.
</p> 
<p>
   JMRI supports the current version (XBus/XPressNet Version 3.0).  We may 
add XBus Version 1.0 and 2.0 support in the future which will allow all XBus 
based systems to work with JMRI.

<h2>Computer Interfaces</h2>
<p>
   There are Three computer interfaces that JMRI has been tested with, and 
developed for.
</p>
<p>
   The Lenz LI100 is Lenz's original computer interface.  It is limited to 
a serial port speed of 9600 baud.

information.</a>

</p>
<p>
   The Lenz LI100F is an improved version of the LI100.  It 
supports serial port speeds of 9600 and 19,200 baud.  The Factory default 
is 9600 baud.

information.</a>
</p>
<p>
   The Lenz LI101 is Lenz's latest computer interface.  It is 
significantly different than the LI100 and LI100F in physical apearance, 
and in the method by which the device is configured.  The device is 
configured via a softwaretool provided by Lenz which runs on Windows only.  
We have included a configuration tool with JMRI that will allow users of 
other operating systems to configure thier LI101 as well.  The LI101 
supports serial port speeds of 19,200, 38,400, 57,600, and 115,200 baud.  
The factory default is 19,200 baud</p>

information.</a>
<p>
   In addition to the Lenz purpose built computer interfaces, we have also 
included support for using an XPressNet Phone Adapter (XPA) as an 
interface to the an XPressNet based DCC system.  This interface is 
relatively slow, and it only allows controlling mobile and stationary 
decoders, but it may be perfect for someone who is interested in trying 
out the control functions of a computer before deciding to go with a full 
fledged interface.

<h2>XPressNet Command Stations</h2>
<p>
   The following command stations support the full range of functions 
provided by JMRI: Lenz LZV100 (software version 3.x) and Lenz LZ100 
software version 3.x).
</p>
   The following command stations support programming and operating 
equipment on a layout, but do not support feedback: Roco LocoMaus 2 (Roco 
Part number 10760) 
<p>
   The following command stations provide support only for operating 
equipment on a layout (running trains and throwing switches): Atlas 
Commander,Lenz Compact, and Lenz LH200.
</p>
<p>
   The following command stations have not been tested for compatability, 
but should be at least partially supported:ZTC Controls ZTC511 (with 
XPressNet V3.0 software), ZTC Controls ZTC521 (with XPressNet V3.0 
software).
