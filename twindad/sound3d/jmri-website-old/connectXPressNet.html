<h2>Connecting to an XPressNet based DCC system</h2>
The Lenz LI100,LI100F, and LI101F interfaces will allow your computer to 
talk to XPressNet, but not all XPressNet based systems can use XPressNet 
communications  for all functions.
<P>
<h3>XPressNet Command Station Function Support</h3>
<p> 
   The following command stations support the full range of functions
provided by JMRI: Lenz LZV100 (software version 3.x) and Lenz LZ100 
(software version 3.x).
</p>
   The following command stations support programming and operating
equipment on a layout, but do not support feedback: Roco LocoMaus 2 (Roco
Part number 10760)
<p>
   The following command stations provide support only for operating
equipment on a layout (running trains and throwing switches): Atlas
Commander,Lenz Compact, Lenz LH200.
</p>
<p>
   The following command stations have not been tested for compatability,
but should be at least partially supported:ZTC Controls ZTC511 (with 
XPressNet V3.0 software), ZTC Controls ZTC521 (with XPressNet V3.0 
software).
</p>
<P>
We have a pretty good handle on what instructions each Lenz Command 
station should support.  If you find that you cannot perform a function 
you think you should be able to using a Lenz system and the LI100 or 
LI101F, Please let us know.
</p>
<h3>Making the XPressNet Connections and configuring JMRI</h3>
<P>
Once you have a LI100 or LI101, connect it to your Lenz system via their
XpressNet connections.  Then connect the LI100 or LI101 to the computer's 
serial port using a 9-pin serial cable.
<P>
Then go to the preferences panel of a JMRI-based program.  This opens 
automatically the first time a program is run, or you can select it from
the "Edit" menu.  
<P>
Select "Lenz XPressNet" from the top selection box. You can then
select the proper serial port in the second selection box.  
<P>
The baud rate selection box should be set to match your LI100 or LI101.
From the factory, the LI100 is set to 9600 baud, The LI101 is set to 
19,200 baud.
<P>
The fourth box should be left on
"hardware flow control" unless you later consistently get a message
about the LI100 control leads being improperly set up, in which case
you might want to try to bypass that by selecting "no flow control".
<P>
The series of radio buttons labelled "GUI style" allows you to select
how the program will look.  
"Metal" is the native Java look available on all types. 
Other choices will vary with your computer type. "Motif", "Windows", "MacOS" 
and "MacOS Adaptive" look native on Linux, Windows, MacOS "Classic" and MacOS X
respectively.
<P>
In the bottom selection box, you can pick the default programmer format. You can
override this each time you open the programmer, so this is here just for convenience.
<P>
Click "Save".  You'll be asked if it's OK for the program to quit, click "Yes".
<P>
Restart the program. You should be up and running.
