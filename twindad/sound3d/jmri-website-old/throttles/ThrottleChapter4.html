				<P>A new throttle window can be started and a DCC address established

				to run a train around a layout, and then close down the throttle

				window when done with it.  This of course loses the configuration

				that you established during this throttle session.  And this is fine

				if you are running a test of sorts on a loco that

				you have no intention of running by one of these computer throttles.

				Therefore, closing down the throttle window to eliminate it would

				suffice.</P>

							<P>But what if you don't want to keep establishing a new

							throttle window each time for one or more locomotives that you intend

							on running from your computer?</P>

							

							<P>If you were following along in the 

							<A HREF="ThrottleChapter2.html">previous chapters</A>

							with building up a new throttle layout and got your train

							moving, then the next question that probably comes to

							your mind is, "how do I save it?"</P>

							

							<P>Following the directions provided in

							<A HREF="ThrottleChapter1.html#MainMenu">Chapter 1</A>

							for locating the Throttle Menu, locate the option

							that says "<STRONG>Save Throttle Layout</STRONG>" (see

							figure 4-1 on the right).  Clicking on this menu option

							will display a "<B>Save As</B>" dialog box

							see figure 4-2 on the right).</P>

							

							<P>By default, it should show the directory where your

							roster file is located.  You can save it to this

							directory if you wish, or you can save it to

							another location of your choosing.  

							For example, the figure on the

							right shows a "Throttles" folder (sub-directory) where all

							throttle layout files are saved.</P>

							

							<P>After entering a file name of your choosing 

							(and optional location)

							that best supports your railroad environment, the current

							throttle layout will be saved with all preferences —

							including window size and location.</P>

							

							<P>After the save is successful, you can close down the

							throttle window.</P>

							

							<DIV>

							Note: the "Save" option will save <U>all</U> currently

							opened throttle windows — they are <U>not</U>

							saved as individual throttles.  This is explained in more detail

							below.

				<H5>Saving Multiple Throttle Windows</H5>

					<P>The above instructions are pretty simple when working with a

					single throttle window.<P>  

					

					<P>But what happens when you have two or

					more throttle windows open at the same time?  When you use the save option,

					<U>all</U> opened throttle windows will be saved in the same file.  When

					that file is re-opened, all throttle windows identified in that file will

					get opened.</P>

								<P>In the previous chapter, a single throttle window was initiated.  And

								a simple "save" would certainly have saved just the single throttle window

								into a single layout file.  When the file is opened again, only the single

								throttle window would appear.</P>

								

								<P>But what if we had opened and configured a second throttle

								window, while the first throttle window was still active on the screen?

								There would then be two active throttle windows that would be "saved" into

								the same layout file (see figure 4-3).

								Not only would the configuration of the throttles be saved, but also the exact

								screen sizing and locations of the two throttles.</P>

								

								<P>When the layout file is

								re-opened, both throttle windows would be opened and positioned on the computer

								screen in the exact place they were when the file was saved.</P>

				<P>After saving a throttle layout has been accomplished, you'll want to open the file again.

				This is a very simple procedure.  However, opening up a throttle layout file when one or

				more throttle windows are already active somewhere on the screen, requires an extra step.

				Before we discuss this extra step, let's first open a simple throttle layout file.</P>

				

				<P>If you were following the guidelines shown above for saving a throttle layout file, you

				should now have created your first throttle file.  If you haven't done so already, close

				down the throttle window that you created in the previous chapter (make sure you saved it

				first by following the above instructions).</P>

							that says "<STRONG>Load Throttle Layout</STRONG>" (see

				<P>The throttle window that you just created should open up in the same place where

				you closed it.  At the same time that the window opens, it is also initializing the

				decoder address to the command station (just like when the address was first "Set").

				The throttle attempts to determine the current direction of the locomotive, as well

				as identify any functions that are in the "on" state.</P>

				

				<DIV>

					Note: Because the JMRI Throttles are still in their "beta" development mode, there are still some

					quirks that need to be ironed out.  An example of this is when opening a throttle

					layout and the DCC address is already "in use" by another throttle.  Some systems

					(i.e. Digitrax) are reacting differently when this occurs.<BR><BR>  

					

					Enhancement requests

					are already on the list for the throttles to be "smart" in determining when another

					throttle already has the address.  But until these throttles are fully implemented, just

					beware that there may be quirks with your particular DCC system with this

					feature.  It is therefore suggested that <U>prior</U> to opening up a saved

					throttle layout file, the DCC address is verified as not being used

					by another throttle somewhere.<BR><BR>

					<P>Throttle layout files can consist of a single throttle window (to control a single

					locomotive or consist address), or it can contain multiple throttle windows (refer to

					figure 4-3).  In either case, when opening a throttle layout file, the program will check

					to see if any existing active throttle windows are already open.  If none are found,

					then the file is opened just like a simple layout opening (explained above).</P>

								<STRONG>TIP!</STRONG>

								</CENTER>

								

								<P>When creating throttle layout files, you can save the same decoder address

								in multiple throttle layout files.  A good example of why you may want to do this 

								would be if you create several throttle layout files,

								each consisting of a single throttle window controlling one single locomotive —

								like one for each loco in your roster.  There may

								be times when you wish to just run a single locomotive and you just open up the associated layout file.  

								Simple!  But what if you find yourself opening up the same locomotive throttles consistently on each session.

								It's going to become a pain opening up (and "merging") these throttles one at a time.  

								Therefore, you could create another layout file that contains all of the throttle windows 

								that you wish; then just open up the one layout file and you'll

								have all of the throttle windows defined.</P>

								

								<P>Just remember, when making a change to the configuration

								of a throttle window, it only gets changed in the layout file that you saved — it is <U>not</U>

								a global change in every file where that locomotive is used.</P>

			<H4>Closing a Throttle Window</H4>

			<DIR>

				<P>When done with a throttle window, it might be a good idea if you get into the practice

				of either "releasing" or "dispatching" the locomotive before completely closing down

				the throttle window.</P>

				

				<P>If you have made any configuration changes to the throttle window, and you want to save them,

				you'll need to follow the steps as outlined above.</P>

				

				<DIV>

					Note: If you "save" any changes that you have made during a session back to an existing throttle

					layout file, beware that <U>ALL</U> currently opened throttle windows will also be saved to

					the same file.

				</DIV>

				

				<P>When you are ready, simply close down the throttle window as you normally would on whatever

				computer system you use.  For example, for Microsoft Windows, simply click on the "<BIG>X</BIG>"

				in the upper right corner of the throttle window.</P>
