      Release Notes for JMRI 2.13.7 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: December 20, 2011</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.13.7 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<!--<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the final download files are not yet available!</b>-->

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 2.14 production release.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

None yet

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

The way in which UserNames are edited in the tables changed in JMRI 2.13.1, renames are now performed via a mouse pop-up menu and can not be directly edited.

<p>
The method we use for building release files was extensively changed with JMRI 2.13.1. Please let us know of any problems
with installation or unpacking.

<p>This release of "DecoderPro 3" is a test.  There are a few more features we'd
like to add, but before doing that we need feedback from users; does it work for
you, what do you want to see changed, etc. We'll look at all the information
which comes back and incorporate it in future developments.
We have tested "DecoderPro 3" and are not expecting major file-damaging faults.
But with any test-release of software there is always a small risk that
something has been overlooked.  So, please check that you have a backup of your
Roster files just in case something unexpected happens.  If you install with the
Windows installer, a backup copy of your old files (including the roster) is
created by default.</p>

<p>
JMRI 2.12 is the last release which is completely supported by Java 1.5.
Starting with JMRI 2.13.1, there are minor interface features, such as 
drag-and-drop of some items, that require your computer to have Java 1.6 installed.
Computers with only Java 1.5 will still be able to use JMRI, including PanelPro and DecoderPro,
through the end of this 2.13.* release cycle.  Releases in the next cycle
will require Java 1.6.

<h3>Changes since test release 2.13.6</h3>

<p>Fixed a problem with Java 1.5 and roster selection in Throttles.
<p>Fixed a problem in the throttle address selection panel if the panel was open and a roster entry was added/updated/deleted.

<p><b>SignalMasts and Logic</b>
<p>Updated the turnout based signalmast to prevents errors from occuring if an appearance does not have a turnout assigned against it.
<p>Fix a bug that prevented a signalmast logic from being created when the source mast was already known.
<p>Fixed an issue relating to the loading of SignalMast logics when "auto discover conflicting signalmasts" was selected.

<p><b>Decoder Pro 3</b>
<p>Fix a bug that is caused when multiple items are dragged into the roster group pane which then prevents items from being selected and displayed correctly in the bottom of the panel.

<p>Pete Cressman fixed a problem preventing Lights on panels from being stored and loaded.

<p>Paul Bender (with help from Kevin Dickerson) added support for the new LI-USB-Ethernet in Etherenet mode.
