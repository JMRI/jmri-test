      Release Notes for JMRI 3.1.6 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: MMM DD, 2012</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 3.1.6 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<br><b>This is a draft release note only; the download links do not yet work</b>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is the next in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.2 production release.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

To allow use of UTF-8 characters (special characters with accents, Japanese text, etc) in XML
files, particularly decoder definitions, the default file encoding has been changed to UTF-8.
This requires a change to the startup scripts distributed with JMRI.
If you're just using the JMRI-provided startup tools, you should be all set.
If you're using your own custom startup scripts, 
you need to add a "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8" option to them. 
If you have any problems with special characters in your existing files, 
please let us know as soon as possible.


<h3>Older warnings</h3>

This release, and all other releases in this cycle, require Java 1.6.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

None at the time of this release.

<h3>Changes since test release 3.1.5</h3>

   <p>Dan Boudreau made the following changes to operations:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Removed switch list and build report options from the Print Options window. Build
     report options now have their own window. Switch list options were moved the switch list window
     that is launched by the "Switch List" button in the Trains window.
    <li>Increased the number of fonts available for operations. Only monospaced fonts are now
     available if you've selected tabular manifests and switch lists.</li>
    <li>Improved the train build reports. Now the build report separates each car being
     processed by a line break in very detailed mode.</li>>
    <li>Fixed a problem with selecting the "Courier" font that was introduced in 3.1.5.</li>
    <li>Fixed a problem with the Switch List window not appearing when the default printer
     wasn't specified on the PC. We only know of one user that has experienced this problem, might
     be related to one of the newer versions of JAVA.</li>
     <li>New feature for trains, you can now prevent local moves even when using custom loads.  See under Edit Train,
     Tools, Train Build Options.</li>
   </ul>
