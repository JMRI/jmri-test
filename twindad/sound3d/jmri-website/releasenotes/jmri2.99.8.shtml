      Release Notes for JMRI 2.99.8 release
      </h2>

	<p>Date: July 12, 2012</p>
	<p>From: Bob Jacobsen</p>
	<p>Subject: Test version 2.99.8 of JMRI/DecoderPro is available for download.</p>
 
<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p>This is a test release.  Please post a note if you encounter any new or old bugs!  
And please back up your JMRI files before installing this, in case you want to go 
back to an earlier version.</p>

<p>This is (hopefully) the last in a series of test versions. We expect this series
to end in a JMRI 3.0 production release quite soon.</p> 

<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.
They may require a certain amount of experience before they are working well.  
Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<p><b>
JMRI is now only available under the 
<A HREF="/COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>. For more information, please
see our 
<a href="/Copyright.html">copyright and licensing page</a>.</b></p>

<h3>New warnings for this version:</h3>

None

<h3>Older warnings</h3>

This release, and all other releases in this cycle, require Java 1.6.

<h3>Known problems with this release</h3>

The consist tool when connected to a NCE command station will not always show all of the available consists, usually 127, 126, and 125 are missing.
As an alternative, you can use the NCE consist tool.  We expect to have this problem fixed in the next test release.

<h3>Changes since test release 2.99.7</h3>

Fixes two issue in DP3 created in 2.99.6 that relate to direct editing of roster entries in the table view.
<ul><li>If the user has clicked on an entry to edit it but made no change, the entry would get re-saved</li>
<li>If the user has a Roster Group selected and edits a roster entry, the incorrect roster entry would be updated</li>
</ul>

<p>
John Crellin provided a MRC Sound Brilliance 1804 decoder definition.

<p>
Robin Becker provided a decoder definition for the Tam Valley Quad-LN family.

<p>
The LocoNet connection preferences include a new option to better control handling of turnout
messages on congested or complete LocoNet networks.

<P>
Updated the "New title" dialog for the layout editor to become a "Edit Title" and pre-populating the existing name.

<p>
All JMRI applications now have a <b>About <i>Application Name</i></b> Help menu item that displays an About dialog. On OS X, this menu item is in the <i>Application Name</i> menu.
