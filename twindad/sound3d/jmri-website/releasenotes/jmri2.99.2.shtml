<p>Some of the changes involved are quite extensive.

Therefore, this test version should be considered experimental.</p>

<h3>Changes since test release 2.99.1</h3>

<p>Dan Boudreau made the following enhancements and fixes to operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new tool to help with custom loads and schedules.  Now you can select a car type
and load and see which spur with schedules will receive and ship that commodity.  See under
Tools "Show schedules by car type and load" in the Schedules window.</li>
<li>Schedules in match mode now shows a hit count.  The hit count is incremented every time a
schedule's line item is used during a build.</li>
<li>Improved the car import feature.  Now the program can be told to automatically create new car types
and adjust track lengths during the import.  Saves a lot of time if your importing a lot of cars with new
car types.</li>
<li>Improved loco and caboose changes in a train's route.  Now you can depart without a caboose and add one
later in the route, or depart with a caboose and remove it in the route.</li>
<li>The switch list button in the Trains window is now highlighted in red when changes occur to switch lists that have
been printed.</li>

</ul>

<p>Kevin Dickerson
<li>Fixed a bug where the PR3 could not operate a throttle in Programming Mode</li>
<li>Add a warning message when a logic is created/edited, that if the source or destination mast is used as part of the criteria with the logic, it may result in unexpected behaviour.</li>
<li>Updated the logic behind the SignalMastLogic in determining routes on the layout editor involving a Double Crossing</li>
<li>Updated the CAN BUS code so that it can handle mutliple connections and be configured with other systems at the same time.</li>

<p>Randall Wood made various improvements to Mac OS X support.</p>

<p>Steve Todd updated jmdns.jar to v3.4.1 (latest release from http://sourceforge.net/projects/jmdns/).</p>

<p>david zuhn fixed the problem with preferences in Mac OS X that first appeared in JMRI 2.99.1</p>
