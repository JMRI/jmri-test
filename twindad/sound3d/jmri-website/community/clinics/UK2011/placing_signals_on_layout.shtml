<h2>Adding Signal Masts to the Layout, and creating Signal Mast Rules</h2>
<p>Signal Mast Rules work from signal to signal. If we consider our layout, and 
  the down line, there is a signal controlling access to platform 2 or into the 
  bay platform (platform 1).</p>
<p><img src="layoutoverview.png" width="830" height="278"></p>
<p>The Down Approach Mast has a signal ahead of it on the Down main line at the 
  end of Platform 2, but currently there are no signals along the bay for the 
  rules from the Down Approach Mast. Therefore, we need to create a virtual signal 
  for use at the buffer stop on the Bay platform (one can think of this as the 
  red lamp or red flag often hung on buffer stops). </p>
<p>Once all the Masts are created, they can be positioned. This is done in the 
  Layout Editor by a command to position a Mast on the context menu (right click) 
  of the block boundaries. </p>
<p>Once Masts are positioned, the rule between them can be created, using the 
  context menu (right click) on the originating mast. This will bring up a dialogue 
  which can &quot;discover&quot; the masts beyond the signal in question, and 
  calculate the rules to use. </p>
<p>The following video illustrates the creation of the virtual signal for the 
  Buffer Stop, the positioning of Masts, and the creation of Rules between them.
