<h2>Extending JMRI with rules in Logix - creating Junction Indicators (Feathers)</h2>
<p>So far, we've built the signalling with the automatic rules within JMRI. But, 
  sometimes it will be necessary to step outside the standard rules and make local 
  adjustments. </p>
<p>In our layout, we have a Junction Indicator (Feather) to show the route is 
  set into the Bay platform. At the time of writing, Junction Indicators have 
  not been built into the JMRI signalling rules, so we need to define our own 
  rules. We do this with Logix. </p>
<p>To begin, we need a Signal Head which controls the Feather. This is defined 
  in the Signal Heads Table as a Single Aspect Signal, which can be &quot;yellow&quot; 
  (or any colour offered!) or &quot;dark&quot;. </p>
<p>Now we need to work out the rules which will cause the Feather to illuminate 
  or go dark. Lets begin with &quot;illuminate&quot;. </p>
<p>To illuminate the feather, the Down Approach Mast should be showing &quot;Yellow&quot; 
  or &quot;Off&quot; (Calling On), and the turnout into the Bay platform should 
  be thrown (route into Bay). </p>
<p>To turn off the feather, the Down Approach Mast should be showing &quot;Red&quot;, 
  or the turnout into the Bay platform should be &quot;closed&quot; (route into 
  Platform 2). </p>
<p>Having outlined our rules in text, we can create two rules in the Logix Table. 
  The video below shows the creation of the Feather Head and the Logix to control 
  it.</p>
