<h3>Summary</h3>

JMRI is an open-source project for developers
to write software for model railroads.
It has achieved wide-spread acceptance, with more than a hundred
people writing parts, and users on every continent
except Antarctica (and we're working on that one!)
<P>
Starting in 2004, JMRI was repeatedly attacked by Matt Katzer
in an effort to stop our efforts and steal our work for his
own purposes.  This ended up in Federal Court in Spring of 2010.
The full story is a 
<a href="History.shtml">long, complicated one</a>,
but we've put a short summary
<a href="summary.shtml">here</a>.

<p>
The end result is that we got a legal order preventing Katzer
from further depredations, and we created some
<a href="news.shtml">legal precedents<a/>
useful to the Open Source community,
but we went 10's of thousands of dollars into debt to do it.
We still need people to 
<a href="/donations.shtml">

</a> 
<A HREF="donations.shtml">contribute</a>
to help pay for the legal expenses, so we can all get back to model railroading.
Anything would be greatly appreciated.
