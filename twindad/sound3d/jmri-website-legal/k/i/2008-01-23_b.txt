The Court has ordered both sides to take part in a settlement conference, 
now scheduled for February 13th before Judge Elizabeth Laporte.  
The judge has 
<a href="/k/docket/199.pdf">ordered Katzer</a>
to provide his 
"position on validity, enforceability and infringement of the '329 patent". 
This order is a positive step for us.  
We've been trying for years to get Katzer to say why he thinks his patents are valid, 
and why he thinks 7,000 people have infringed them. 
We think he knows that his patents are invalid and unenforceable,
and that he knows his claims of thousands of infringements are a dishonest 
attempt to extract money that no one ever owed to him. 
Many of his actions in this case seem to have been intended to delay 
proceedings so he wouldn't have to provide a detailed answer to the complaint, 
including this information. Now he's been ordered to provide it by January 31, 2008.  
We're looking forward to getting this information.
