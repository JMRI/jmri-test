On October 15, 2008, Katzer filed a 
<a href="/k/docket/247.pdf">motion</a>
requesting that he be allowed to file a declaration "under seal". 
This is usually used for trade secrets and similar information
that shouldn't be made public. 
Putting the information under seal allows the Court and the parties to reference
it while still protecting the information from public disclosure.
In this case, however, Katzer has also asked that Jacobsen
not be allowed to see the information. 
<p>
We filed an 
<a href="/k/docket/248.pdf">opposition</a> to this, pointing out that
Katzer's request didn't comply with the relevant
<a href="http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/LocalRul.nsf/fec20e529a5572f0882569b6006607e0/7f39eafb2106e6db882569b4005a23f1?OpenDocument#TOC2_119">rules of civil procedure</a>, and puts us 
at an extreme disadvantage in rebutting Katzer's statements.

<p>
Katzer then filed another 
<a href="/k/docket/249.pdf">declaration</a>, and several days 
later provided the declaration that he proposed to be sealed.  
We <a href="/k/docket/251.pdf">replied</a>, pointing out several ways that Katzer's
request was still in violation of procedural rules and with basic fairness.
<p>
The Court agreed, and 
<a href="/k/docket/252.pdf">ruled</a>
that Katzer could not submit his declaration under seal, 
but could ask again. Katzer didn't do so.
