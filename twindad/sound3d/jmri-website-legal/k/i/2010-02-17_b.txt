We have agreed with Matt Katzer to settle the case
and end the legal dispute.

<p>
The 
<a href="http://jmri.org/k/docket/402-1.pdf">settlement agreement</a>, 
which is now a legally-binding contract signed by both sides, 
accomplishes several things:

<ol>
<li>
A 
<a href="http://jmri.org/k/docket/402-2.pdf">permanent injunction</a>
will be entered by the Court,
expressly forbidding Katzer from further misuse of the software
that JMRI has created, and forbidding him to register any domain
names that should rightly belong to us.
<p>
In the past, Katzer has told people that we've copyrighted
manuals that others wrote, or trademarked terms that belong to
others.  Neither of these are true, and we've shown in Court
that Katzer has no evidence for his statements.
To prevent 
there being any uncertainly about this, the agreement 
explicitly states that we're not talking about anything from the
NMRA or other manufacturers.
<p>
This injunction is important.  We consider his misuse of 
JMRI's decoderpro.com domain name and the decoder definition
files to have caused significant damage to JMRI, and
this injunction makes it clear that the Court will not allow 
it to happen again.

<li>
Katzer explicitly releases all JMRI users and developers 
from any liability for anything related to JMRI, up until
18 months from now.  This means that he can't try to extract
patent royalties, claim infringement, argue that somebody
infringed a copyright, or anything else.  He has no right to 
complain about anything we've done in the past or will do 
in the near future.

<p>
The goal was to make sure that this dispute really is over, and
won't rise from the grave like a zombie that has to be 
<a href="http://www.mathstat.uottawa.ca/%7Ersmith/Zombies.pdf">fought over and over again<a>.
Katzer has said that he just wants to move on and put legal disputes
behind him, and this provision is aimed at making sure that's 
what happens.

<p>
As a matter of fairness, Jacobsen extended the same release to Katzer.

<li>
A procedure was put in place for handling any future disputes, after
the 18 month period is up.  This has some important features:
<ol>
    <li>It's "loser pays", so neither side can bring spurious
        complaints without risk.
    <li>It's based on mediation and arbitration, so it's 
        faster and can include people with more technical and
        model railroading background.
    <li>It forbids going outside the agreed procedure, for
        example to contact an employer or relative in an
        attempt to apply pressure. 
</ol>
<p>
If anybody really does do something wrong, this provides a way
to deal with it, while making it riskier and more difficult
for anybody to try to make spurious claims.

<li>
Katzer will pay $100,000, spread over the next 18 months.
<p>
Despite generous support from over a hundred people,
the costs defending against Katzer
over the last six years are significantly more than 100K$.  
(Things like court reporters for depositions, travel
expenses, and expert witnesses have to be paid for, and it
adds up very quickly.)
Katzer's payment gets us part-way back to where 
we would have been if all this hadn't started in the first place.
<p>
To be sure, he has had significant costs of his own, and he has to pay them
too. 

<p>
Although this doesn't entirely cover our costs, we believe this
is the best we could do at this point, and there was no 
certainty that going to trial in June would result in a damage
award large enough to offset the large additional costs of a trial.

<p>
Sometimes, the best you can do is the best you can do.
</ol>

<p>
This is not air-tight, in that it doesn't extend to 
e.g. future patent complaints about future patents, 
after the next 18 months. 
We believe that 
we've still got a very strong position on those,
as Katzer stated in Court that JMRI didn't infringe any of 
his existing patents, 
because Katzer's ongoing chain of patents 
actually document the same set of claimed 
inventions, and because quite a few people 
have helped us accumulate several file drawers of 
strong prior art to defeat future patents.

<p>
It's very hard to craft an agreement that constrains all
possible future behavior, 
so in the end you have to 
trust that the people making the agreement are going to live up to 
the intent of it.
As Henry Stimson said, "The only way to make a man trustworthy is to trust him", 
and that's what we're doing here. 
We believe that this agreement has the right structure to motivate everybody to 
just work on their own stuff without getting into fights, and 
that it's fair.  
We're going to trust Katzer to approach it on that same basis.

<p>
We could not have reached this point without the help of the
hundreds of model railroaders who have contributed money, time and
knowledge to this effort, the open-source advocates and organizations
who have worked on the legal effort, and particularly without the huge
efforts by Victoria Hall, David McGowan and the other lawyers who have worked 
on this over the past six years. We'll have more to say about this
later, but the message for right now is that we all owe them
a huge debt of gratitude.
