October 25, 2006:
Given the strength of the evidence that Katzer copied from
JMRI, and given that it appears that he's going to continue,
we asked the court for a preliminary injunction. The
<A href="/k/docket/114.pdf">motion</a>
was accompanied by 
<A href="/k/docket/index.shtml#114">two declarations and several exhibits</a>.
This was scheduled for a hearing on January 19, 2007.
