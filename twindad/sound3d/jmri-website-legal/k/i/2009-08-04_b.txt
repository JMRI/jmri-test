The Association for Competitive Technology (ACT)
has filed an 
<a href="/k/docket/cafc-pi-2/ACT-Amicus-Brief-Filed-Version.pdf">amicus brief</a>
is support of Katzer in our 
appeal of the January decision.

<p>
ACT's motto is "protecting small business innovation".
Their online blog had previously commented on the first appeal on their
<a href="http://blog.actonline.org/2008/08/federal-circuit.html">ACT Online</a>
blog.  They were one of the few commentators that disagreed with the decision.

<p>
They're an interesting organization.  
They apparently were
<a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Association_for_Competitive_Technology">created in response to the anti-trust suit against Microsoft</a>.
Despite having a 
motto of "protecting small business innovation",
their 
<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9131834/Microsoft_gains_familiar_ally_in_IE_antitrust_battle_in_Europe">positions are often very closely aligned with Microsoft</a>, 
and

that help small companies.

It seems that Matt Katzer has interesting friends.
