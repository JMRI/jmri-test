On January 18, 2008, we filed
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml#198">our response</a>
to Katzer's 
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml#192">most recent motion to dismiss</a>. 
That motion attempted to
get rid of various parts of our recent Second Amended Complaint
regarding copyright, contract and DMCA violations.
In our response, we show that Katzer misstated both law and facts, 
and show that the Court should allow us to hold Katzer
responsible for his actions in stripping the 
copyright management information out of the JMRI files, for repeatedly infringing
JMRI copyrights, and, if Katzer's argument that he had a contract is valid, for
violation of that contract.
<p>
The next step will be Katzer's reply, due on Friday January 25th, which we
will post on the 
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml">docket page</a> when it arrives, followed 
by a hearing on March 14th.
