On December 17th, 2007, we filed our 
<a href="/k/docket/cafc-pi-1/AppellantsBrief.pdf">appellant's brief</a>
in our 
<a href="2007-09-13.shtml">appeal of the Court's copyright ruling</a>
with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
It lays out, in detail, the legal reasons
we believe that the District Court's copyright ruling is
incorrect and should be overturned.

Katzer's reply to this is due on January 29th, 2008.
