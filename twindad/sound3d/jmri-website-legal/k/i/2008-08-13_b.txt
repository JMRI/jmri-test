The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
has issued its
<a href="/k/docket/cafc-pi-1/08-1001.pdf">decision</a>
in our copyright appeal, and it's a ringing victory
for JMRI and open-source in general.

<p>
In summary, the Court decided:
<ul>
<li>The Artistic License does put valid conditions on the use 
of licensed software.
<li>Those conditions limit the copyright license, and 
actions outside them are infringement. 
<li>An injunction to stop that infringement is a suitable remedy.
</ul>

<p>
Specifically, the Court wrote:

<blockquote>
It is outside the scope of the Artistic License to modify and distribute 
the copyrighted materials without copyright notices and a tracking of 
modifications from the original computer files. 
If a downloader does not assent to these conditions stated in the COPYING
file, he is instructed to "make other arrangements with the Copyright Holder." 
Katzer/Kamind did not make any such "other arrangements."
The clear language of the Artistic License creates conditions to protect the 
economic rights at issue in the granting of a public license. 
These conditions govern the rights to modify and distribute the 
computer programs and files included in the downloadable software package. 
The attribution and modification transparency requirements directly 
serve to drive traffic to the open source incubation page and to inform 
downstream users of the project, which is a significant 
economic goal of the copyright holder that the law will enforce. 
Through this controlled spread of information, the copyright holder 
gains creative collaborators to the open source project; by requiring that 
changes made by downstream users be visible to the copyright holder 
and others, the copyright holder learns about the uses for his software 
and gains others' knowledge that can 
be used to advance future software releases.
</blockquote>

<p>
The Appeals Court ruled that the lower court's decision is
"vacated and remanded". This returns the case to the District Court
for Northern California, which must decide on a remaining question
before issuing the injunction.

<p>
Although there will be some further proceedings, this is a huge
step forward for us.  The appellate judges have ruled that when Kater
took JMRI files, modified them, and distributed them
as if there were his own, he was violating copyright law and we can 
hold him accountable.  

<p>
It's also an important result for open-source software in general,
because (to quote 
<a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2008/08/huge_and_important_news_free_l.html">Larry Lessig's blog</a>):
<blockquote>
In non-technical terms, the Court has held that free licenses such as the CC licenses set conditions (rather than covenants) 
on the use of copyrighted work. 
When you violate the condition, the license disappears, meaning you're simply a copyright infringer. 
This is the theory of the GPL and all CC licenses. 
Put precisely, whether or not they are also contracts, they are copyright licenses which expire if 
you fail to abide by the terms of the license.

<p>
Important clarity and certainty by a critically important US Court.
