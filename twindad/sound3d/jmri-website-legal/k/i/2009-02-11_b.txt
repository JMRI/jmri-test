On February 11, we received Katzer's long-awaited Answer to our suit. 
It's a <a href="/k/docket/290.pdf">29 page PDF document</a>
available, along with all the other filings in the case, on the 
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml">docket page</a>.

<p>
We still carefully considering it, and more information will follow. 
There is one striking thing, however: Katzer is now suing Bob 
Jacobsen for copyright infringement of the QSI decoder manuals and 
asking for damages "in excess of $6,000,000"! 
(page 28 of the <a href="/k/docket/290.pdf">filing</a>)

<p>
We'll post another note on the updates page and via the email list
after we've evaluated the filing.
