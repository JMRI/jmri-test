On September 4th, 2007, we 
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml#159">asked the Court to reconsider</a>
its decision on the cybersquatting claim.
We believe that the Court misunderstood our argument.
Unfortunately, the Court has 
<a href="/k/docket/161.pdf">denied this request</a>.  
<p>
We're considering what the next step will be.  We can wait 
until the rest of the case has been resolved, and then appeal this 
decision (you can't appeal something like this until it's final, and
that generally means when the case as a whole is complete), but we
are also investigating other alternatives.
