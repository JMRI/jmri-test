On February 13, 2008,
we had a settlement conference before Judge Laporte at the San Francisco Federal Courthouse.
Discussions in settlement conferences are confidential, 
so we are severely limited in what we can discuss about what happened there, 
except of course what's in public orders. The case didn't settle,
and that's about all we can say.
