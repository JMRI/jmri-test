Normally, one side files a motion, the other side files an opposition,
and then the first side files a reply to the opposition.  The reply is
not supposed to carry new argument. When one side doesn't follow the
rules and raises new issues in a reply, or when new facts arise, a party
can ask for permission to file a "surreply" to comment on the new
argument or the new facts.

<p>
Because Katzer raised new issues after opposition was filed, and because
we now have additional information, we filed surreplies to both Katzer
motions on December 8, 2008.

<p>
The <a href="/k/docket/272-2.pdf">copyright surreply</a>
refutes some of Katzer's arguments by showing
that he has misquoted case law or used case law that doesn't apply.
Katzer had argued that no statutory damages or attorneys fees were
available to Jacobsen because the first version of JMRI wasn't
registered prior to Katzer's infringement, but we showed that it doesn't
matter that the version wasn't registered. As long as some versions are
registered, and Katzer infringed those later versions after registration
or within three months of publication, then statutory damages and
attorneys' fees are available.

<p>
We filed the <a href="/k/docket/274.pdf">patent surreply</a> 
because Katzer, and his intellectual
property attorney Kevin Russell, who had permission to file a response
but <a href="/k/docket/index.shtml#253">filed it 4 weeks late</a>, 
filed responses in which they, once again,
tried to mislead the Court. We argued that the Court has jurisdiction to
hear the '329 patent because of anti-SLAPP and because Jacobsen is
prevailing party. Katzer and Russell said that they disclaimed the '329
patent because of "practical considerations" and "economic reasons", and
argued that our jurisdiction arguments were a motion for
reconsideration. We responded to these arguments to correct the record,
and discussed some new information that we had learned.
