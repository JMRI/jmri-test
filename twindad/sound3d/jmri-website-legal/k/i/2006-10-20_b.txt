On October 20th, 2006, the Court issued its
<A href="/k/docket/111.pdf">written order</a>
on the initial motions.  
The decision was along the lines of the 
<A href="/k/docket/86.pdf">minute order</a>
issued right after the hearing
and 
<A HREF="2006-08-13.shtml">discussed previously</a>.
The Court did find that the full amount of the legal 
fees demanded by Jerger and Zeff was "excessive" and "unreasonable", 
so it reduced the amounts
to $14,486.68 and $16,976.25 respectively.
