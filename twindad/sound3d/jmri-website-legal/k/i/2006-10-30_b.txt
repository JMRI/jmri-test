On October 30, 2006, we filed a 
"<A href="/k/docket/120.pdf">Motion for Leave to File</a> Motion for Reconsideration, Motion for Stay, and Request for Clarification".
This was a preliminary step required before seeking reconsideration of the 
written order of October 20th, 2006.
It lays out the reasons why we think that reconsideration is justified.
The Court 
<A href="/k/docket/121.pdf">denied the request</a>
that same day. 
As a result, 
Bob paid the 
<A HREF="2006-10-20.shtml">legal fees demanded</a> by Jerger and Zeff.
David Zeff wasn't content
to actually wait for the deadline, however, and sent another
<a href="/k/docket/122.pdf">threatening email</a> (see page 15 in the linked filing).
