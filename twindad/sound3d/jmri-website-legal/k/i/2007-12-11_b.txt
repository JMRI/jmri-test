Although Katzer had previously agreed to the filing of either of our
draft complaints 
(see <a href="2007-10-31.shtml">above</a>),
he's clearly still more interested in delaying the case rather than
resolving it, so on November 2nd, he filed an 
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml#178">opposition</a> to our 
request to file the complaint.  He then followed this up
with a 
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml#184">request for sanctions</a>.
<p>
In typical style, he misstated law and facts in these filings,
and didn't obey the Court's rules regarding notice.  
We filed a 
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml#185">motion</a>
pointing this out, and asking that the hearing on sanctions
be deferred until proper notice had been given.  
Katzer's
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml#186">reply</a>
included additional misrepresentations, and the 
Court 
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml#187">denied our motion</a>.
We felt we had no choice but to file our own
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml#188">motion for sanctions</a> to at least bring this 
misbehavior to the attention of the Court.
<p>
On December 11th, the Judge 
<a href="/k/docket/190.pdf">allowed</a>
the filing of our preferred version of the new complaint and
<a href="/k/docket/190.pdf">denied</a> the requests for sanctions.
<P/>
We then filed
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml#191">second amended complaint</a>
on December 12th. 
The Court has set a deadline
of January 4th, 2008, for Katzer to either file his reply, 
or start another round of motions.

<p>
This is a big victory for us.  
We've learned a lot about Katzer's misdeeds over the 
last year. This new complaint puts it all before the Court, 
including Katzer's cybersquatting,
and will (eventually) force him to reply in detail to each item. 
He's been able to avoid
doing that for almost two years, but his time is running out.
