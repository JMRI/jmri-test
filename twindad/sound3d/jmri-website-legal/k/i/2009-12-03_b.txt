Today (December 3, 2009),
Court has issued its 
"<a href="/k/docket/393.pdf">Notice of Tenatative Ruling and Questions</a>"
for the Summary Judgment hearing tomorrow (December 4).
<p>
This provides three questions that both sides will be asked to address:
<ul>
<li>
Is the question of originality of the copied work an issue of fact 
or an issue that can be resolved as a matter of law?  
Is there a dispute of fact regarding whether the selection 
and arrangement of data in the copied files is sufficiently original
to be copyrightable?
<li>
If the Court considers the expert reports submitted by Plaintiff, 
is there a dispute of fact 
regarding the damages allegedly sustained by Plaintiff?  
Regardless, does the Federal 
Circuit's holding in this matter, 535 F.3d 1373, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2008), 
as well as the 
testimony of Penny and Jacobsen indicate that Plaintiff suffered damages, 
even in the 
absence of a specific monetary figure?
<li>
Specifically where in the record is there a dispute of fact regarding whether the scope of 
QSI's permission was actually communicated to Plaintiff?
</ul>
