We have a new schedule for the case.
<p>
As 
<a href="/k/docket/398.pdf">ordered by the Court</a>,
we'll have a 
<a href="/k/docket/396.pdf">settlement conference</a>
on January 28, 2010.
We hope that we can work something out either before
or at that conference. Settlement discussions are confidential, so 
we can't say much more than that.
<p>
In the meantime, we've asked the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit in Washington DC to delay the hearing on our copyright appeal.
If we can reach a settlement, there's no need for that hearing.
<p>
If we can't reach a settlement, 
we have a trial scheduled to start
on June 1st, 2010 in San Francisco.
The steps leading up to that are listed in the Court's
<a href="/k/docket/398.pdf">scheduling order</a>.
