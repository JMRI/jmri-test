Katzer had 
<a href="/k/docket/cafc-pi-2/Katzer-response-in-opposition-to-amicus-brief.pdf">objected</a>
to the Software Freedom Legal Center 
filing an 
<a href="/k/docket/cafc-pi-2/SFLC-amicus-brief-6-15-09.pdf">amicus brief</a> 
with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,
and the SFLC had 
replied
to those arguments.

<p>
The Appeals Court has now 
<a href="/k/docket/cafc-pi-2/Order-Granting-SFLC-Permission-to-File-Amicus-Brief.pdf">ruled</a>
entirely in the
SFLC's favor on this, and will
consider the brief.
