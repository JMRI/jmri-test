On November 7th, 2008, Katzer filed documents in the three existing motions.
<p>

He filed a 
<a href="/k/docket/257.pdf">reply</a> to our opposition to his motion to 
dismiss our patent claims as moot.  
He also filed a 
<a href="/k/docket/258.pdf">reply</a> to our opposition to his other motion, to dismiss
and to strike parts of our complaint against him. At first glance, this
contain the same arguments as before, trying to distract the Court 
from the real issue that Katzer is likely to continue to assert his 
improperly obtained patents.
<p>
Interestingly, Russell also filed a
"<a href="/k/docket/253.pdf">response</a>", along with a
<a href="/k/docket/256.pdf">declaration</a> from Katzer and a 
<a href="/k/docket/254.pdf">declaration</a> from Russell himself. 
We're not entirely certain that this is even a reponse
<u>to</u>, because Russell is no longer a party to the case at this own request.

<p>
We're still studying these, and will determine our next steps soon.

As expected, Katzer also filed an 
<a href="/k/docket/260.pdf">opposition</a>
to our motion for preliminary injunction, along with a
<a href="/k/docket/261.pdf">declaration</a> from Katzer and a number of 
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml#261">exhibits</a>.
A first look indicates that Katzer is claiming that he <u>does</u> 
have permission to use the JMRI content because he holds the copyright on a
QSI manual, because the JMRI decoder definitions are merely "manufacturer information", 
and because they "build on an effort" started by Katzer "to construct a
master, uniform template of manufacturer's specification data". 
We disagree about all of this, and our reply will strongly rebut Katzer's evidence.
Katzer is clearly still asserting that he has a right to use our
content in violation of our license, and that he doesn't think
he's done anything wrong.  We also disagree about that.  Our reply to 
this is due November 21st, and will be on the 
<a href="/k/docket/index.shtml">docket page</a> shortly after it's filed.
