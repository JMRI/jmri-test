We have filed our 
<a href="/k/docket/cafc-pi-2/AppellantBrief.pdf">Appellant Brief</a> 
in our
appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

<p>
It lays out the reasons that we think
that the
ruling
of last January should be overruled. 

<p>
This is the start of the briefing
process, to be followed by an
(expected) opposition from Katzer 
and a final reply from us.
