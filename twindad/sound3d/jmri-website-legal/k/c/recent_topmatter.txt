<h2>JMRI Defense: Recent Events</h2>

This page describes recent events in the main case, 
in most-recent-at-the-top order.
Other information and arrangements 
are available from the left-side menu.
The entire story, in historical order
(read from the beginning through to now)
is on a 
<a href="History.shtml">separate page</a>.

<p>
The navigation bar to the left has links to more information, 
or you can go back to the 
<a href="/k/index.shtml">main page</a>
for an overview.

If you'd like to get email when we update these pages, please subscribe to the 
<A HREF="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jmri-legal-announce">jmri-legal-announce</a>
mailing list at SourceForge.net.  
This will carry short announcements occasionally as news happens.
There won't be a lot of traffic. 
It's not a list for discussion and strategizing; for various reasons, 
we can't do that on a public list.
