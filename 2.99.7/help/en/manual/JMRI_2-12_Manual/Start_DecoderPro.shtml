  Once you have downloaded the Decoder Pro software and installed it, simply
  open the program in the usual manner for your operating system. You should
  see this or a similar opening screen displayed:
  
<h1><img src="images/Splash_Screen.png" alt="DecoderPro Splash Screen" width=425 height=265 border=10 class="BOXIT"></h1>

<p>
It may take a while for this screen to come up, especially on older
and slower computers. Remember that you are essentially running the program
on a Java emulator over your native operating system software. New computers
can do this fairly quickly, but older ones will feel like they're taking
forever. Be patient - it will come up eventually! Even on older computers, once the program is up the response time is quite good.
<p>If this is the first time you have run the program after you installed the software, the <a href="Start_Preferences.shtml">Preferences</a> screen will  come up automatically to allow  you to set up the system for your particular configuration.&nbsp; Also if you change  your system configuration, OR if you have your laptop away from the railroad,  but you want to play with JMRI there is a simulator mode you may want to  try.&nbsp; &nbsp;So click next, and we&rsquo;ll have a look at  preferences.
