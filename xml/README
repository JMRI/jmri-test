The xml/ directory contains DTDs defining various model railroad constructs, 
XML files describing various types of model railroad equipment, and
some sample XML files. 

Currently, these are defined via DTDs. We intend to move to schema quite soon,
particularly to pick up validity checking.

Subdirectories:
	programmers - 
	decoders -
