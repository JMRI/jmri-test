  <!-- This file sets the values returned by the SignalSpeedMap class.  It is designed to -->
  <!-- set the defaults for running Warrants.  However uses other Warrants are possible.  -->
  <!-- If so, make the necessary changes you desire.  However,                            -->

  <!-- The "aspectSpeeds" table below maps the speed names used in signal aspects.xml  -->
  <!-- files to a number. The number may be translated to a throttle setting.  The     -->
  <!-- meaning of the number may be given two different interpretations.               -->

  <!-- Interpretation: A hint for how the code may use the number.       -->
  <!-- percentNormal is the percentage of the recorded speed.  The speed -->
  <!-- when running with no signals or aspect clear.                     -->

  <!-- stepsPerIncrement is the number of throttle speed increments to use per the -->
  <!-- above ms time. The time needed to ramp a speed change can be shortened      -->
