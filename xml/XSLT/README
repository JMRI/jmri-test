README for xml/XSLT in the JMRI distribution.

See COPYING for license information.

This contains XSLT transformations of the XML information maintained
by the JMRI project.  build.xml is the ant build control file for
performing these transformations. In general, these transformations put 
their results in "pages" subdirectory that is not present in CVS.

Common & summary Ant targets:

 	xslt		run the whole sequence of processing

	init    	create needed directories
	clean   	remove compilation results to force rebuild
	copyDTD		ensure local DTD file copies present where needed for processing
	copyXML		ensure local XML file copies present where needed for processing
 
Create the by-decoder web pages and index:

	index 		create a decoder index page
 				uses DecoderModelIndex.xsl
 			
	models		tranform definitions into web pages
 				uses DecoderModelList.xsl
 
Create other views as web pages:			

	selection	create HTML decoder selection guide listing various properties
 				uses SelectionGuide.xsl
 	
 	cvsummary	create HTML page listing CVs available on all decoders
  				uses CVsummary.xsl, interestingCVs.xml
 
Create views as CommaSeparateVariable files:

	csv			create CSV file listing CVs available on all decoders
 				uses CSVsummary.xsl, interestingCVs.xml
 			
 				create CSV file listing decoder sizes
 				uses SizeAsCSV.xsl
 				
 				create CSV file listing decoder power limits
 				uses PowerAsCSV.xsl
