Title: 'inControl'
------------------
Description: A web page to control JMRI
References: This development is based on the JMRI info, specially on the files distributed in the Mini Web Server directory
Acknowledgements: Thanks to Bob Jacobsen and Steve Todd for their contribution
Notes:  'inControl' is free.
Version: 1.2.1 (look for updates in http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jmriusers/files/WEB_control)

-------------------------------------

Files in root directory:
	inControl.html (the throttle/panel)
	inControlMulti.html (a throttle/panel set - several throttles/panels on screen - copy and modify as you wish)
Files in 'inControl' subdirectory:
	(default and sample images)
	inControl.txt (this one - you should read it first)
	inControl.js (the javascript code)
	inControl.css (the stylesheet)
These files/dir must be loaded into one of the Mini Web Server directories (usually c:\Program Files\JMRI\web).
You should access the HTML pages from a browser (ex.: http://192.168.1.55:12080/web/inControl.html).
Please check jmri.sourceforge.net and jmriusers Yahoo group on how to use the Mini Web Server.

-------------------------------------

Works better on JMRI 2.11.2 or newer version

Tested with good results on several browsers (on PC, Android, ...).

*** inControl.html *** (the throttle/panel)
-------------------------------------
The page is not sent to the server (submited) when you click the buttons.
It uses AJAX to reduce data flow (+ responsiveness).
The page is only tranfered from the server when you 'call' it or when you 'refresh' it.
The page height depends on page width and its content.
The page content depends on the parameters you fill in when you call the page.

These are the parameters to control the throttle/panel configuration:
- debug (if this parameter is not empty, the user should receive debug info in dialog boxes)
- waitforresp (if this parameter is not empty, all the calls to XMLIO are synchronous - default: asynchronous)
- refreshrate (Refresh Rate to retrieve JMRI power status (seconds) (0= no refresh / default=5))
- functioncolumns (number of function key columns (default=1))
- width (page width in pixels - default=200)
- power (the layout power control is shown if this parameter is not empty - if 'r' or 'R' it will be displayed in the second column)
- locoaddress (the address to show in the page title and board - default=3)
- loconame (the name to show in the page title and board) 
- locoimage (the image URI to show in the page board)
- f<n>label (text to show in the function key button - <n> between 0 and 12)
- f<n>image (URI of image to show in the function key button)
- f<n>imagepressed (URI of alternate image for function key pressed and locked - works only as a flag if 'f<n>image' is empty)

You may use your own images.
You should store your image files in the JMRI 'prefs' dir (usually C:\Users\<username>\JMRI).

Examples: (You only need to insert this info once for each loco and save the URL to the browser favorites)
http://192.168.1.5:12080/web/inControl.html
http://trainserver:12080/web/inControl.html?width=500&power=r&locoaddress=17&f1imagepressed=x
http://192.168.1.5:12080/web/inControl.html?width=300&power=x&loconame=Loco2&locoimage=inControl/Loco2.jpg&f7label=myF7&f8image=inControl/Sound.png&f8imagepressed=inControl/SoundPressed.png&f9label=F9
: You need to insert a question mark (?) between the page URL and the parameters.
: Between each parameter you need to insert an ampersand (&).
: Each parameter is defined this way: <name>=<value>.
: Avoid to insert special characters in loco name and function labels (if you do, you should 'translate' them: http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/ref_urlencode.asp).
: Keep the images small (loco image should be wider than taller).
: Because each device/browser has different sizes, you should try several 'width' and 'functioncolumns' to achive the best image.

*** inControlMulti.html *** (a throttle/panel set - several throttles/panels on screen - copy and modify as you wish)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are going to have several pages like this one, you should change the filename and tittle in order to differentiate them.
You may change the text between '<title>' and '</tittle>' (the page tittle).
You may add, modify or remove the lines beginning with '<iframe':
- modify the 'src' value (...inControl.html...) in order to show the desired throttle/panel configuration
- modify the 'width' and 'height' in order to acomodate the throttle/panel size
Examples: (You may save the URL to the browser favorites)

+ Known issues ---------------------------------------------------------------

None.

+ Wishes for future developments ---------------------------------------------

Get info from roasters.
Implement web pages for layout panels (turnouts, signals, ...).
