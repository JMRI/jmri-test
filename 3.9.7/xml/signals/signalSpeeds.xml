  <!-- Meaning of the number used for the aspectSpeeds names in the aspectSpeeds  -->
  <!-- table below. The table maps the names used in signal aspects.xml files to  -->
  <!-- a number that is translated to a throttle setting.                         -->
  <!-- percentNormal is the percentage of the recorded speed (the "Normal" speed  -->
  <!-- percentThrottle is the percentage of the full throttle speed               -->

  <!-- Speed changes are ramped from the current indication to the next.          -->
  <!-- Throttle speed commands are sent incrementally with a delay between them.  -->
  <!-- The delay in milliseconds between speed increments sent to the throttle.   -->
  <msPerIncrement>750</msPerIncrement>
  <!-- Time needed to ramp a speed change can be shortened      -->
