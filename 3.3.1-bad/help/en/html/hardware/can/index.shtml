<h1> 
JMRI: CAN Network Support
</h1>

There's an emerging trend to develop model-railroad control systems
that are based on standard CAN network technology.  
JMRI provides 
support for the development and use of these.

<p>
Two initial efforts:

<a href="http://www.openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a>
<dd>
OpenLCB is a group of hobbyists and manufacturers who have 
come together to produce a future-oriented layout control bus, also called
<a href="http://openlcb.org">OpenLCB</a>.
<p>
JMRI includes 
<a href="../openlcb/index.shtml">basic support for OpenLCB</a>, 
and more is being developed along with OpenLCB itself.

<p>
<img src="http://www.nmra.org/common/nmra_logo.jpg" align="right" alt="NMRA logo" height="45" width="55">
The <a href="http://www.nmra.org">NMRA</a> has 
<a href="http://nmranet.org">decided</a> 
to adopt OpenLCB and standardize it under the 
<a href="http://nmranet.org">NMRAnet name</a>.

<a href="http://www.merg.org.uk/resources/lcb.html">CBUS</a>
<dd>
A group of hobbyists, under the umbrella of the Model Electronic Railway Group 
(<a href="http://www.merg.org.uk/">MERG</a>), 
are developing a layout control bus called CBUS.
They are creating 
<a href="http://www.merg.org.uk/resources/lcb.html">extensive documentation</a>.
<p>
JMRI includes 
<a href="cbus/index.shtml">basic support for CBUS</a>, 
and more is being developed along with CBUS itself.

<h2>Capabilities</h2>

JMRI provides a basic 
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/AbstractMonFrame.shtml">monitor tool</a> 
for watching traffic on a CAN bus.
<p>
There's also a 
<a href="../../../package/jmri/jmrix/can/swing/send/CanSendFrame.shtml">tool for sending</a> CAN frames manually and in 
sequences.
<p>
JMRI can provide the usual Sensor and Turnout features once configured for
<a href="../openlcb/index.shtml">OpenLCB</a> or
<a href="cbus/index.shtml">CBUS</a> "events".

<p>
For development, there are 
<a href="scripting.shtml">scripting tools</a>
for sending and receiving CAN frames.  
These can be very useful in testing hardware, etc.

<h2>Configuring a CAN connection</h2>
<a name="connect"/>
JMRI can connect to CAN networks several ways.  
<p>
There are various CAN-USB adapters available:

<dl>
<dt>TCH Technologies
<dd><a href="http://www.tchtechnology.com/products/can_usb/">TCH Technology CAN/USB</a>
which provides a high-speed connection for model railroad use
<dt>gridconnect
<dd><a href="http://www.gridconnect.com/canboandto.html">GridConnect</a> CAN_RS,
which is also the protocol used by the MERG CAN_RS board
<dt>lawicell
<dd><a href="http://canusb.com/">LAWICEL AB</a> 
CANUSB and CAN232 adapters.
</dl>
To use any of these, select the appropriate device type in the 
JMRI preferences.  If using a GridConnect or Lawicel device, be sure to
set the appropriate baud rate under advanced preferences.  The TCH Technology 
adapter does this automatically, so no setting is required.

<p>
It's also possible to attach via a TCP/IP connection (EtherNet or WiFi), 
but you'll have to make your own connection for this.
