/**
 * Common utility methods for working with Locales.
 * <P>
 * We needed a place to refactor common Locale-processing idioms in JMRI
 * code, so this class was created. It's more of a library of procedures
 * than a real class, as (so far) all of the operations have needed no state
 * information.
 * <P>
 * In particular, this is intended to provide Java 2 functionality on a
 * Java 1.1.8 system, or at least try to fake it.
