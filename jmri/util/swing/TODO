Things to do:

* A single action provides one pane. Need a way to cache
    between separate instances, so that e.g. a "Foo" menu
    item and tool bar button will show the _same_ panel instance?
    
* Put the right stuff in the help menu depending on what's displayed,
    and where the focus is?
    
* SDI needs to get menu, title and help info right

* How do to "double click to open in a new window?"

* Add icons to tree with a custom renderer that looks for one in the Action?

* Have editing Sensor Table, but not merged the two forms (original JmriJFrame
    and new JmriPanel form)

* Create actions for Window menu - paned mode will have multiple
    windows with same name?
    
* MDI mode hasn't gone far

* Apps3 in apps3.paned needs to move up to apps3, so it forms the
    new base for multiple kinds, include an SDI mode.
    
* documentation of Menu/Tree/ToolBar XML form!
