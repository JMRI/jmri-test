/**
 * Interface for an object that can arrange for a 
 * JComponent to be displayed.
 * <p>
 * Typically used by some component that wants to display
 * a pane (e.g. in a JmriJFrame) to do some more stuff.
 * Rather than have the component build it's own window, etc
 * it invokes one of these, so that the position and 
 * display of that component can controlled.
 * <p>
 * Any JmriAbstractActiont that uses the show() method
 * will have its dispose() invoked when the associated frame
 * goes away.  It should dispose() any cached panes at that time.
