/**
 * Represents a particular piece of track, more informally a "Block".
 * A trains move around the layout, a set of Block objects interact to
 * keep track of which train is where, going in which direction.
 * As a result of this, the set of Block objects pass around  "token" (value)
 * Objects representing the trains.  This could be e.g. a Throttle to
 * control the train, or something else.
 * <P>
 * A Block (at least in this implementation) corresponds exactly to the
 * track covered by a single sensor. That should be generalized in the future.
 * 
 *<p>
 * Objects of this class are Named Beans, so can be manipulated through tables,
 * have listeners, etc.
 *
 * <p>
 * There is no functional requirement for a type letter in the System Name, but
 * by convention we use 'B' for 'Block'. The default implementation is not 
 * system-specific, so a system letter of 'I' is appropriate.  This leads to 
 * system names like "IB201".
 *
 * <P>Issues:
 * <UL>
 * <LI> Doesn't handle a train pulling in behind another well:
 *      <UL>
 *      <LI>When the 2nd train arrives, the Sensor is already active, so the value is unchanged (but the value can only
 *          be a single object anyway)
 *      <LI>When the 1st train leaves, the Sensor stays active, so the value remains that of the 1st train
 *      </UL>
 * <LI> The assumption is that a train will only go through a set turnout.  For example, a train could
 *      come into the turnout block from the main even if the turnout is set to the siding.  (Ignoring those
 *      layouts where this would cause a short; it doesn't do so on all layouts)  
 * <LI> Does not handle closely-following trains where there is only one 
 *      electrical block per signal.   To do this, it probably needs some type of
 *      "assume a train doesn't back up" logic.  A better solution is to have multiple
 *      senors and Block objects between each signal head.
 *</UL>
 *
 *<P>Do not assume that a Block object uniquely represents a piece of track.
 * To allow independent development, it must be possible for multiple Block objects
 * to take care of a particular section of track.
 *<P>
