Provides implementations of various JMRI interfaces.

<p>
As a long term project, we'd like to get the various Abstract* and Default*
implementations out of the {@link jmri} package itself, and moved 
into here.

<p>
Implementations that use Swing should be put in the
{@link jmri.implementation.swing} package.

<!-- Put @see and @since tags down here. -->
@see jmri.managers
@since 2.1.5
