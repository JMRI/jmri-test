/**
 * Represent a signal mast.  A signal mast is one or more signal heads
 * that are treated as a single signal.  (Imagine several heads 
 * attached to a single mast, though other implementations are possible)
 * <P>
 * A mast presents an Aspect, as that's a composite of the appearance
 * of the entire signal.
 * <P>
 * This class has one bound parameter:
 *<DL>
 *<DT>aspect<DD>The specific aspect being shown.
 * <p>
 * Aspects are named by a user defined String name.
 *</dl>
 * The integer state (getState(), setState()) is the index of the
 * current aspect in the list of all defined aspects.
