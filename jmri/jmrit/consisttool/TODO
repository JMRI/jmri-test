Todo as of 12/24/2003

   Should we ask if the consist should be cleared when the consist is 
     deleted or the window is closed?

   Need to build a method to recall a consist, both between sessions and 
     durring a single sesion of the program.
     (should this be stored in XML, or recalled from the Command Station
     if possible?)

   To go along with above, we need to find a way to insert a consist into 
     the roster for the throttle commands.

   The selection buttons for Advanced/CS Consist is present, but does not
     do anything yet

   The Current Tool has a limit of 4 locomotives in the consist.  This is 
     artificial, since the back end does not have a limit.
