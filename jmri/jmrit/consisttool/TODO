Todo as of 8/22/2004

   Should we ask if the consist should be cleared when the consist is 
     deleted or the window is closed?

   Need to build a method to recall a consist between sessions
     (should this be stored in XML, or recalled from the Command Station
     if possible?)

   To go along with above, we need to find a way to insert a consist into 
     the roster for the throttle commands.

   The selection buttons for Advanced/CS Consist is present, but does not
     do anything yet

   Need to add a  method to restrict the number of locomotives in a consist
   if the consisting method limits the number of units in a consist on a 
   particular system.

   Table in tool has a slot for roster entry, this needs to be filled in 
   or removed.
