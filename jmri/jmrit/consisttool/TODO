Todo as of 11/03/2004

   Should we ask if the consist should be cleared when the consist is 
     deleted or the window is closed?

   Need to build a method to recall a consist between sessions
     (should this be stored in XML, or recalled from the Command Station
     if possible?)

   To go along with above, we need to find a way to insert a consist into 
     the roster for the throttle commands.

   Need to add a  method to restrict the number of locomotives in a consist
   if the consisting method limits the number of units in a consist on a 
   particular system.

   Table in tool has a slot for roster entry, this needs to be filled in 
   or removed.

   Per request from widebayburnett, add button to "Reverse Consist" (change 
   normal direction of consist to the reverse of what it currently is, 
   including decoder specific reversals where required.

   Per request from widebayburnett, add an "uncouple" button, that 
   deletes locomotive consist information so consist can be reordered, but 
   does not delete locomotive from consist list.
