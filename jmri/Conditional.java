/**
 * A Conditional is layout control logic, consisting of a logical 
 * expression and an action.
 * <P>
 * A Conditional does not exist on its own, but is part of a Logix.
 * The system name of each Conditional is set automatically when
 * the conditional is created.  It begins with the system name of
 * its parent Logix.  There is no Conditional Table.  Conditionals
 * are created, editted, and deleted via the Logix Table. 
 * <P>
 * A Conditional has a "state", which changes depending on whether its
 * logical expression calculates to TRUE or FALSE. The "state" may not
 * be changed by the user. It only changes in response to changes in
 * the "state variables" used in its logical expression.
 * <P>
 * Listeners may be set to monitor a change in the state of a 
 * conditional.
