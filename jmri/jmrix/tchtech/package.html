Interfaces and implementations for TCH Technology system-specific code.

<P>
This package was created by Tim Hatch in August 2007 and the following months,
based closely on the C/MRI code of that vintage.  

For more information on TCH Technology itself, please see
<a href="http://www.tchtechnology.com/">their web pages</a>.
