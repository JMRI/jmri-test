/**
 * XNetInterface defines the general connection to a XNet layout.
 * <P>
 * Use this interface to send messages to a XNet layout.
 * Classes implementing the XNetListener interface can register
 * here to receive incoming XNet messages as events.
 *<P>
 * The jmri.jrmix.lenz.LnTrafficManager provides the first implementation
 * of this interface.
 *<P>
 * How do you locate an implemenation of this interface?  That's an interesting
 * question.  This is inherently XNet specific, so it would be inappropriate
 * to put it in the jmri.InterfaceManager.  And Java interfaces can't have static
 * members, so we can't provide an implementation() member.  For now, we use
 * a static implementation member in the LnTrafficManager implementation to locate
 * _any_ implementation; this clearly needs to be improved.
 *<P>
 * XNetListener implementations registering for traffic updates
 * cannot assume that messages will
 * be returned in any particular thread. See the XNetListener doc
 * for more background.
