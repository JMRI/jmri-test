TODO List for Lenz code (as of 2/28/2004):
1) Need to add  listeners to all classes that SEND messages so they 
recieve the apropriate response messages.  On classes where more than 
one instance may exists, need to syncronize the listeners for the messages
that DO NOT include addresses (The Throttle is one of them).  
2) Need to seperate constants for Xpressnet V1 from those for X-Bus V1 
and V2.
3) Implement a browser for the Command Station Locomotive database 
(similar to the Digitrax "Slot Manager")
4) Need to make sure we can listen to the different type of messages for 
each class, instead of listen for ALL messages (i.e. need to make the mask
parameter to "addXpressnetListener" work properly)
5) Revise utility programs so they use a properties file for button 
names/menu titles.
6) Add a message box indicating another device has put the command station 
in service mode.  This should automatically appear and disappear as 
appropriate.
