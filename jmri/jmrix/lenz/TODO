TODO List for Lenz code (as of 9/03/2003):
1) Need to add  listeners to all classes that SEND messages so they 
recieve the apropriate responce messages.  On classes where more than 
one instance may exists, need to syncronize the listeners for the messages
that DO NOT include addresses (The Throttle is one of them).  Also, need 
to make sure we can listen to the different type of messages for each 
class, instead of listen for ALL messages (i.e. need to make the mask
parameter to "addXpressnetListener" work properly)
2) Need to write Feedback code
3) Need to seperate constants for Xpressnet V1 from those for X-Bus V1 
and V2.
4) Implement Operations Mode Programing
5) Implement a browser for the Command Station Locomotive database 
(similar to the Digitrax "Slot Manager")
