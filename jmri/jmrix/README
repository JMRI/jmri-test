The jmrix Java package defines implementations for the JMRI interfaces.

Currently existing packages include:
	jmrix.loconet   - implementations of the DigiTrax Loconet
	jmrix.nce       - implementations for North Coast Engineering
	jmrix.direct    - implementations for direct rail drive, where the
						program creates the DCC drive signal directly
