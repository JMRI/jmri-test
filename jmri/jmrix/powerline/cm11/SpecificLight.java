/**
 * Implementation of the Light Object for X10 CM11 interfaces.
 * <P>
 * Uses X10 dimming commands to set intensity unless
 * the value is 0.0 or 1.0, in which case it uses on/off commands only.
 * <p>
 * Since the dim/bright step of the hardware is unknown then the Light
 * object is first created, the first time the intensity (not state)
 * is set to other than 0.0 or 1.0, 
 * the output is run to it's maximum dim or bright step so
 * that we know the count is right.
 * <p>
 * Keeps track of the controller's "dim count", and if 
 * not certain forces it to zero to be sure.
 * <p>
