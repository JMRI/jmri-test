Provide GUI tools for editing an SDF file in memory.

<p>
The text for each of the editor panels comes from the
"Explanations" properties set (see Explanations.properties and 
translations).  The editors themselves are coded as subclasses
of {@link SdfMacroEditor}, one per instruction type.

<p>
Note that the editor is "live"; changing an option on an editor
window changes the memory version of the instruction, including the 
disassembled version.

The SDF information is manipulated using the 
{@link jmri.jmrix.loconet.sdf}
package.
