/**
 * Provide a JPanel to configure the programming mode.

 * The using code should get a configured programmer with getProgrammer.
 * <P>
 * This pane will only display ops mode options if ops mode is available,
 * as evidenced by an attempt to get an ops mode programmer at startup time.
 * <P>
 * For service mode, you can get the programmer either from here
 * or direct from the instance manager.  For ops mode, you have to
 * get it from here.
 * <P>
 * Note that you should call the dispose() method when you're really done, so that
 * a ProgModeSelector object can disconnect its listeners.
