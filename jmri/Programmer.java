 * "Programmer" is a capability to program decoders.  These come in two types:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>Service Mode, e.g. on a programming track
 * <LI>Ops Mode, e.g. "programming on the main"
 * </UL>
 * depending on which type you have, only certain modes can
 * be set.

 * You get a Programmer object from a ProgrammerManager, 
 * which in turn can be located from the InstanceManager.
