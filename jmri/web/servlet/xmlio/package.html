JMRI XML I/O protocol. The XML format is described by

If a &lt;list&gt; or &lt;throttle&gt; element is present,
an immediate operation is used so the result can be returned.
Otherwise, a deferred operation is used, returning
the result only when one of the indicated beans has changed
it's value.

Both GET and POST operations are supported.
