/**
 * Get access to available {@link Programmer} objects.
 * <P>
 * Programmers come in two types:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>Global, previously Service Mode, e.g. on a programming track
 * <LI>Addressed, previously Ops Mode, e.g. "programming on the main"
 * </UL>
 * You get a {@link Programmer} object from a ProgrammerManager, which in turn can be located
 * from the {@link InstanceManager}.
 * <P>
 * The ProgramerManager also provides a reserve/release
 * system for tools that want to pretend they have exclusive use of a Programmer.
 * This is a cooperative reservation; both tools (first and second reserver) must
 * be using the reserve/release interface.
