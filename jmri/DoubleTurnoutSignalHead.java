/**
 * Drive a single signal head via two "Turnout" objects.
 * <P>
 * After much confusion, the user-level terminology 
 * was changed to call these "Double Output"; the class
 * name remains the same to reduce recoding.
 * <P>
 * The two Turnout objects are provided during construction,
 * and each drives a specific color (RED and GREEN).
 * Normally, "THROWN" is on, and "CLOSED" is off.
 * YELLOW is provided by turning both on ("THROWN")
 * <P>
 * This class doesn't currently listen to the Turnout's to see if they've
 * been changed via some other mechanism.
