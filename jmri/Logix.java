 * A Logix is a group of Conditionals that monitor one or more conditions 
 * (internal or on the layout) and take action when these conditionals 
 * change in a user specified way.
 * <P>
 * A Logix can be enabled or not.  By default it is enabled and will act
 * when one or more of its Conditionals changes in a user specified way.
 * When not enabled, the Logix will not trigger actions when its 
 * Conditionals change.  Enabled is a bound property of a Logix.
 * <P>
 * A Logix does not have a "state", however, each of its Conditionals does.
