/**
 * A Throttle object can be manipulated to change the speed, direction
 * and functions of a locomotive.
 * <P>
 * A Throttle implementation provides the actual control mechanism.  Clients
 * then provide GUI throttles, automated start/stop, etc.
 * <P>
 * What's the multiplicity of Throttle objects?  Entirely separate
 * locomotives, etc, need their own.  But can there be more than one
 * Throttle working with a single locomotive, e.g. for a buddy throttle,
 * or to display the status of a physical throttle on a screen.
 * <P>
 * Our working model was that there's _something_ in the control system
 * hardware that's the resource represented by a Throttle, so there's
 * a limited number of Throttle's available. A single Throttle object
 * can be used by multiple cabs via the parameters, parameter change
 * notifications, etc.  This implies that we should be able to assign
 * and deassign locos from this throttle, but that doesn't seem right.
