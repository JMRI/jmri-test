/**
 * Represent a Turnout on the layout.
 * <P>
 * The AbstractTurnout class contains a basic implementation of the state and messaging
 * code, and forms a useful start for a system-specific implementation.
 * Specific implementations in the jmrix package, e.g. for LocoNet and NCE, will
 * convert to and from the layout commands.
 * <P>
 * The states  and names are Java Bean parameters, so that listeners can be
 * registered to be notified of any changes.
 * <P>
 * A sample use of the Turnout interface can be seen in the jmri.jmrit.simpleturnoutctrl.SimpleTurnoutCtrlFrame
 * class, which provides a simple GUI for controlling a single turnout.
 * <P>
 * Each Turnout object has a two names.  The "user" name is entirely free form, and
 * can be used for any purpose.  The "system" name is provided by the system-specific
 * implementations, and provides a unique mapping to the layout control system
 * (e.g. LocoNet, NCE, etc) and address within that system.
 * <P>
