<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Prior to using the programmer you  need to have completed the previous section (<a href="Start_DCC.shtml">Getting Started</a>), have your computer connected to  your command station/booster with the required interface device for your DCC  system, you are now ready to actually program a decoder that has been installed  in your locomotive.</p>
<p><br>
  On opening DecoderPro, the main  page will be displayed: (After preferences are set) The list of locomotives programmed by DecoderPro3 will be blank until you add a locomotive. From then on when it is opened a list of all the locomotives whose decoders you have programmed in DecoderPro3 will be listed.</p>
<p>DecoderPro3 provices access to the JMRI tools required to program DCC decoders. If you are an advanced user, using PanelPro to run your layout, then you may start PanelPro and then from the File menu start DecoderPro3.</p>
<p>DecoderPro3 by itsself may program DCC decoders and also use those tools to manually operte your trains from the computer interface Throttle control and power control of your layout.</p>
<p>The DecoderPro3 window is divided into five main section from top to bottom.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="images/start_dp_main01.png" width="900" height="521" alt="dp3 main"></div>
<p>1. The Menu Bar.<br>
2. The Tool Bar<br>
3. The Roster Table (a list of all the docoders in your roster.<br>
4. The Decoder Information Area.  Show information about any selected locomotive in the roster list.<br>
5. A status bar that reports information about DecoderPro3 operation including errors.</p>
<p>At this time we have no entries in the Roster list of locomotives. We will now add our first locomotive to the list.</p>
<h4><strong>Adding New Locomotive</strong></h4>
<p>On the Tool Bar is an icon labeled<strong> New Loco</strong>, click on the icon and the <strong>Create New Loco </strong>window opens. Now with the locomotive with the decoder installed placed on the Programming Track (Service Mode), click on Read type from decoder button (mid right side)<br>

<p>Several possible decoders are highlighted. This happens because the decoders are electrically the same but are packaged differently to fit the locomotives that they are used in. If you know which decoder is in use, then select that one. If not, in most cases any of the highlighted decoders will work.</p>
<p>I know that this decoder is DN143IP plug-in version for a Burlington Zepher in nscale. So I will select that decoder.</p>

<p>Note that we have selected a decoder, which is highlighted. Also the<strong> Open Programmer</strong> button is activated to allow us to enter the programmer, which Pr<strong>ogrammer format</strong>: is <strong>Basic</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/dp3_createnewloco_decoder.png" width="556" height="594" alt="decoder select"></p>
<p>Click on the Open Programmer button and the<strong> Roster Entry</strong> Pane will open for the Basic Programmer. Go to the next page</p>
